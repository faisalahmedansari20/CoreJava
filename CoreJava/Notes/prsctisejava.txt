public ConcurrentHashMap(int initialCapacity,float loadFactor,int concurrencyLevel)
what is the difference between HashMap and HashTable popular interview Question
HashMap class Objects values are iterated by usinr the iterator  HashTable and vector is the only  class which uses enumerator  to iterate  the values of HashTable Object
LinkedList can be iterated in reverse direction  using descendingiterator() while there is no descendingIterator() in arrayList  so we need to write our own  code to iterat  over the ArrayList in reverse direction
Comparable is an public interface which is used  to impose an natural ordering of the class that implments it .
objects are compared in comparable interfacce is using thier ACSII value whic h means comparable by default uses the sorting technique of JVM.
Collections.sort(Arrays.sort)
in comparavle only one sort sequence can be created  while in  comparator many sort sequence can be created.
comparator interface has the method public int compare(object obj2,object obj2)
while comparable interface has the method compareTo(object o)
comparable interface define in java.lang package while comparator is define in java.util package
Map.Entry is the static nested class that stores the key/value pair that forms one element of HashMap.
Entry objects in the bucket class in the following way (hash,key,value,bucketindex) from this we can ensure that  we need hashvalue and bucket index besies key to get access to the desired Entry Object in the HashMap
How HashMap remove removes key value pair in java
Map.Entry is the static nested class that stores the key/vlaue  pair  that forms  one element of HashMap
Entry Object Stores in the bucket in the following way (hash,key,value,bucketIndex)
public class HashMap<K,V> extends AbstractMap<K,V> implements MAP<K,V>
{
indexFor
removeEntryForKey
recordRemoval(this)
removeEntryForKey()

recordRemoval( this)is a concrete method without anybody  it is invoked  it is invoked whenever the Entry is removed from the Table.
How HashMap and Hashtable works internally
two unequal Objects may return same hashCode()
but if twi Objects are equal by equals method then they must have the same hashCode()
it is requirement key Object in HashMap to implement the equals and hashCode method in java.
what happen when you call the get() method  with key Object t retrieve corresponding value from hash based collection
key.hashCode() method is used to find the bucket location in backing array remember that HashMap is backed by array in java.and the value is returned by the hashCode function .
in backing array or better known as bucket key values are stored  in the form  of a nested class called if there is only one entry at bucket location then  the value from that entry  is returned pretty straightforward right.
what happen if two key  has same hashCode()  if multiple keys have the same hashCode()  then during put() operation collision has occured means multiple entry Objects stored in a bucket location each entry keeps track of another Entry form linked list data structure
now if we need to retrieve the value Object in this situation
then called hashCode() method of the key to find bucket location
traverse thought linked list comparing keys in each entries using  keys.equals() until it returns .
HashMap and alll other hash table based Map implementation classes in java handle collision by chaining  they used linked list  to store map entries which ended in the same bucket due to a collision .if a key end up in same bucket due to a collision .if key end up in same bucket location where an entry's is already stored then this entry is  just added at the  head of the linked list there and this degrades the performance of the get() method of HashMap to O(n) from O(1) . in java started the balanced tree instead oflimked list for storing collide entries
and in the worst case you will get a performance boost from O(n) to O(log)
remove()
poll()
element()
peek()
remove() and poll() method is used to remove the Object and returns the head of the queue if the queue is empty then call to remove() method  will throw Exception  while  call to poll() method returns null.
collection interface defines the remove method to remove Objects from Collection .List interface adds another method remove(int index) which is used to remove Object at specific index..you need to iterator 's remove method .this method removes current  element from iterator perpective
if we use Collection or List remove() method during iteration then your code will throw ConcurrentModificationException
what is the difference between synchrinized collection and Concurrent Collection in java collection java added many concurrent classes concurrentHashMap ,CopyOnWriteArrayList,BlockingQueue,etc.
concurrent collection has the better performance than synchronized collection  becuase they lock omly portion of Map to achieve concurrency and synchronization Iterator is more safe than Enumeration and does not allow another thread to modify the collection Object during the iteration  except remove() method and throws ConcurrentModificationException
HashSet is build on the Top of HashMap
if  we look the java.util.HashSet then we find that it uses a HashMap with same values for all keys
private transient HashMap map;
private static fianal Object present-new Object();
public boolean add(E e)
{
 return map.put(e,present)==null;
}
if you using any custom Object in Map as key you need to override the equals() ans hashCode() method  and make sure that they follow their contract on the other hand if you are storing a custom Object in sorted Collection
concurrentHashMap is mor Suitable for situation where you have multiple readers ane one writer Map is locked during the write operation  if you have the equal number of reader and writer than ConcurrentHashMap will perform in the line of HashTable or synchronized HahsMap
Sorting is implemented usring Comparable and Comparator in java when we call the Collections.sort() it gets sorted based on the natural ordering in compareTo() method while Collections.sort(Comparator) will sort Objects Based on somapre() method of Comparator.
Enumeration is an interface is containing the methods for accessing the data structure from which the data is obtain it allows the sequential access to all the elements stored in the collection .
what is the difference between Enumeration and Iterator ?
Enumeration acts as a Read only interface .bacause it has the method only to traverse and fetch the Objects
whenever there is a possibility that multiple threads accessing the same instance then we have to use vector .non synnchronize data structure gives the better performance than the synchronize one .
>what is the importance of the hashCode() and equals() methods? how they are used in java ?
java.lang.Object has two methods define in it
public boolean equals(Object o)
public int hashCode().
these  two methods are heavily used when Object stored in collections.
whenever hashCode() method is invoked on the same Object more than once  in a application it will give the same integer value
if two Objects are equals according to equals method then calling the hashCode() method on two Object is will give the same integer value ot hashCode vlaue .producing the distinct integer result for unequal Objects may improve the performance of hashtable .
equals method
reflexive symmetric  and transistive
Sets use equals() to enforce non duplicates and HashSet uses hashCode() as a first-cut test for  equality. Technically hashCode() is not necessary then since equals() will always be used in the end ,but providing a meaningfull hashCode() will improve performance for very large sets or Objects thst take a long or Objects
>what is the difference between Sorting performance of Arrays.sort() Collections.sort() both have the same algorithm the  only difference between is type of input to them.Collections.sort() has the input List so it does a translation  of Lost to array and vice versa which is an additional step while sorting.
>what is BlockingQueue and how it can be used ?
bloclingQueue waiting for a queue to become non empty when retrieving an element and wait for space
>which implementation of the list interface provides for the fastest insertion of a new element into the middle of the list
ArrayList and vector both uses the array to store the elements of the list
the LinkedList uses the doubly Linked List to store the elements
an insertion requires only the updating of the links at the point of insertion  therefore the linkedList allows  for fast insertions and deletions.
>what is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList ?
LinkedList  is made up of a chain of nodes .each node stores an element and pointer to the next node .
Arraylist is much faster than the LinkedList for random access,
System.arrayCopy() where as LinkedList are faster for inserts and deletes anywhere in the list.
an instance of Hashtable has two parameters that effects the performance
:initial capacity and load factor the capacity is the number of buckets in the hash table and the initial capacity is simply the capacity at the time hash table is created .a single bucket can store the multiple entries which must be searched sequentially .the load factor is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased
HashMap
this implementation provides constant-time Big O Notation O(1) performance   for the basic operations to get the iteration performance then not set the initial capacity too high or the load factor too low if iteration performance is important.
TreeMap implementation provides guaranteed log(n) Big O Notation  time cost for the containsKey get key ,put and remove operations
HashSet class offers constant-tine O(1) performance for the basic operations(add,remove,contains and size)assuming the hash function disperse
LinkedList
Performance of get and remove methods is linear time Big O Notation  O(n)
and Iterator.remove methods is constant-time
the initial size of arrayList is empty get set iterator and listIterator operations run in constant time but it  worst  case since array must be resized and copied  adding n elements requires linear time
java collection FrameWork is pivotal in developing high performance reusable  and reliable java application designed by joshua j.Blch in early 2000s
what is java Collection FrameWork and what is the use of java collection framework ?
java collection FrameWork represents the set of classess and interfaces which provides an efficient way to store and handle data in a java application .it includes several classes that supports operations like searching sorting insertion manipulation and deletion .

java programming language is the brain child of james gosling who designed it  in early 1995.

what are the Main Benefits of java  Collections Framework ?
performance
reusability
maintainability
Extensibility
>what is the difference between Collection and Collections Framework ?
collection is an Object container that can hold multiple elements and functions as a single unit .
collection framework provides a centelized system for managing and representing collections.
iterable interface is a part of the <java.lang>
also the oracle java collection documentation states that collection interface is a member of the java Collection framework which belongs to the java.util package.
map is the two dimensional data structure which stores data in the form of key-value pair. the map is essentially a set and cant have duplicate elements  Iterator is an interface .you can locate in the java.util package
to use an Object as the key in HashMap we can implement equals() and hashCode(0 methods.
Collection.reverse(ListObject)

List<String> arrayList=new ArrayLIst<String>();
arrayList.add("how are you");

String[] strarr=arrayList.toArray(new String[arrayList.size()]);
we will wish you to that the abve questions will help you for the preparation  of the java interview questions.
>why Map interface does not extends Collection  interface ?
set is unorderd collection and does not allows duplicate elements
list is ordered collection and allows duplicate elements
where Map is a key pair  and it is viewed as set of keys and collection of vlaues .Map is a collection of key value pairs so by design they separated from collection interface
Iterator type  in Hashtable is a fail safe where is in HashMap it is fail-fast and HashMap is fast in performance as compared to Hashtable .Superclass is a Abstract class
>what is the difference between Comparable and Comparator ?
Comparable interface is from java.lang package and it has the method compareTo(Object obj) to sort the elements
where as the Comparator interface is from java.util package and it has the  method compare(Object obj1,Object obj2)
>How can we sort a list  of Objects ?
there are two methods by which we can sort the elements of the  list Object .
to sort the array of object we will use Arrays.sort() method.
and if we  need to sort the collection Object we will use Collections.sort()
>what is the difference between fail fast and fail safe ?
fail fast is nothing but the immediate report of any failure .whenever problem occurs in the  fail fast system then the system is fail .
in java when we iterate collection Object using the Iterator some times there  is an exception in throw by the system ConcurrentModificationException
there are two reason for this exception
if one thread is iterating the a collection  and another thread is trying to modify the collection then Exception is thrown by the system
and after the  remove method call if we try to modify collection Object.
>what is the difference between  Iterator,ListIterator  and Enumeration
Enumeration is a legacy interface.and it uses the elements method
Iterator is implemented on all java collection  classes.
Iterator uses iterator() method
Iterator can traverse  in forward direction only.
ListIterator is implemented only for List type classes
ListIterator uses listIterator() method

>how to make a collection thread safe
vector,hashtable,properties and stack are synchronized  classess , so they are thread safe and can be used in multi-threaded environment.
by using the Collections.synchronizedList() we can make list classess thread safe.
by using java.util.synchronizedset() we can make set classess thred safe
>which design pattern Iterator follows ?
Iterator design pattern
>which data structure HashSet implements
Hashset implements hashmap internally.
>why does not collection extend cloneable and serializable ?
equals and hashCode  methods are define in the Object class
>what is the difference between array and arrayList ?
array is a collection of similar data type and fixed size
where as the ArrayList is a collection of homogeneous and heterogeneous elements .
>what is the proprties class?
properties class are the subclass of Hashtable . it is used to maintain list of values in which the  key and the  values is String
>how to convert a String array to arrayList ?
ArrayList al=new ArrayList(ArrayList(new String[]{"",""}))
or arrayList.toArray();
what are the difference between Comparable and Comparator in java Collection
one of the common interview question asked in the iterview that what is the difference between comparator and comparable interface
Comparable interface is used for the natural sorting there is a reason all wrapper classes and String class implementing this comparator and override compareTo(Object o) method.
Wrapper classes :
wrapper  classes is used to convert primitive data into java for java has  8 primitive data type.
package java.lang;
public final class Integer extends Number implements Comparable<Integer>
>what is the difference  between Enumeration and Iteration
Enumeration is a legacy interface,it uses elements() method,it can traverse in forward direction only,it have a methods  like hasMoreElement() and nextElement()
where as Iterator is implemented on all java collection classes
Iterator uses iterator() method
it can traverse in forward direction only
it has the methods like hasNext(), next(),remove().
if(!treeMap.isEmpty())
ListIterator is implemented only for List type classes.
it uses listiterator() method
listIterator can traverse in forward and backward directions
it has methods like
hasNext()
Stream is a sequence of data in java Stream is composed of bytes it is called  a stream because it is like a stream of water  that contini=ue to flow
OutputStream and InputStream
java application uses the OutputStream to write data to a destination it may be a file an array peripheral device like socket
public void write(int)throws IOException it is used to write a byte to the current output stream
public void flush() throws IOException
public void close() throws IOException
FileOutputStream
java Console class is used to get input from console it provides methods to read texts and passwords.
Console c=System.console();
String n=c.readLine();
Writer is an abstract class for writing to character Streams.
Writer w=new FileWriter("");
String content="";
w.write();
w.close();
java Reader class is an abstract class for  reading character streams the only methods that a subclass must be implemented are read()
java BufferedReader class is used to read the text from a character based input stream
java printStream class is used to write data to a multiple stream
pushbackInputStream class overrides inputstream and provides extra functionality to another input Stream it can unread  a byte which is already read and push back one byte.
pushbackReader class is a character stream reader it is used to pushes back
java StringWriter class is a character stream that collects output from String buffer which can be used to construct a String the java StringWriter class inherits  the writer class.
java io interview Questions and answers
>what is IO stream?
it is a stream of data that flows from source to destination good example is copying the file two streams are involved input stream and outputstream
>what is the necessity of two types of streams byte Streams and character Streams
ans:byte streams were introduce with jdk 1.0 and operate on the file containing ASCII characters.we know java supports other language characters also known as Unicode characters to read the files containing Unicode characters designer introduced character streams with JDK 1.1  as ASCII is a subset of unicode for the files of English characters we can go with either  byte streams or character streams
ASCII is a subset of Unicode for the files
>what are the super most classes of all streams ?
all the  byte stream classes can be divide into two categories input stream and output stream  and all the character stream classes divided into two  part reader classes and writer classes there are four abstract  classes from which all these streams are divided
super most class of all byte stream classes is java.io.InputStream and all output stream classes java.io.OutputStream
for reader classes java.io.Reader and java.io.Writer
>what is FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
ans:these classes used by the  programmer very often to copy file to file .these classes work well with files containing less data of a few thousand bytes as by performance these are very poor.for larger data  prefered BufferedInputStream or BufferedReader and BufferedOutputStream BufferedWriter
it is better to use BufferReader in place of BufferedInputStreams and DataInputStream
>what is System.out.println() ?
println() is a method of PrintStream class out is a static object of printStream class .defined in System class System is a class define in java.lang package used to interact with  the underlying operating system by the programmer.
>what are the filter streams ?
Filter streams are a category of IO stream whose  responsibility is to add extra functionality to  the existing streams like giving line numbers in the destination file that do not exist int the  source file or increasing performance of copying etc.
>name the  filter streams availavble ?
there are four filter streams in java.io package two in byte streams side and  two in character streams side
FilterInputStream
FilterOutputStream
FilterReader
FilterWriter
there are the abstract calsses and we can not create Object of these classes.
>name  the filter stream classes on reading side of byte stream ?
there  are  four classes 1>LineNumberInputStream(it adda line numberin the destination file)
DataInputStream contains special methods like readInt(),readDouble() readLine()
3>BufferedInputStream gives bufferung effect that increases the performance to the peak and PushbackInputStream pushes the required character back to the  system .
>what is the functionality of SequenceInputStream ?
>what is the functionality of SequenceInputStream ?
it is used to read data from multiple files and write into  a single file.
>what is PrintStream and PrintWriter ?
in functionality both  are same but belongs to different categories byte stream and character stream println method exist in both classes
>which streams are advised to use have maximum performance in file copying ?
BufferedInputStream  and BufferedOutputStream on byte stream side and BuffereReader and BufferedWriter on character streams side.
>what are piped streams ?
there are four piped streams pipedInputStream ,PipedOutputStream,PipedReader  and PipedWriter these streams are useful to pass data between  two running threads say process.
>what is File class?
it is a non-stream (not use for operation ) class used to know the properties of a file like when it  was created has read and write permission size etc
>what is randomAccessFile ?
it ia a special class from java.io package which is neither  a input stream nor outputstream becuase it can do both it is directly a subclass of Object class all the methods of DataInputStream and DataOutputStream exist in RandomAccessFile.
>what is the difference between System.out, System.in,System.err?
System.out and System.err both represent the monitor by default and hence can  be used to send data or result to the monitor.but System.out is used to display normal message and result where as System.err is used to display error meesage and System.in represents InputStream Object
>what are the  purpose of the System class ?
The  purpose of the System class is to  provide access to system resources.
>what is the abstract parent class of FileWriter ?
OutputStreamWriter
>which class is used to read streams of characters from file?
FileReader
>which class is used to read streams of raw  bytes from a file ?
FileInputStream
>which is the parent class of FileInputStream ?
InputStream
FileNotFoundException
NotSerializableException
>what do we understand by fair locks ?
java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock
in java there is a two type of lock is availble
intrinsic lock and Explicit lock
whenever we synchronized any object we get an Intrinsic lock on that Object.
there is also one way to implement using Explicit locks
java.util.concurrent.locks package provides some explicit locking classes which can be used to replace the intrinsic locks one of commonly used example of explicit lock is ReentrantLock
there is more reason that to use tryLock() method which helps to prevent the deadlock scenario I will
problem is that in case of multiple threads asking fore a shared lock ,we want to ensure that the thread get the lock the longest thread in waithing on  the lock Object.
java thread fair  lock and unfair lock detail
there are two kinds of synchronization fair and unfair lock
lockInterruptibly()
wait() and notify() method is
by acquiring the intrinsic lock  and calling the Object wait()
>is it possible to check whether a thread holds monitor lock on some given Object ?
the class java.lang.Thread provides the static method Thread.holdsLock(Object) that returns true if and only if the current thread holds the lock on the Object given as argument to the method invocation.
>what does the method Thread.yield() do ?
an invocation of the static method Thread.yield() gives the schedular a hint that the current thread is willing to free the processor .the schedular is free to ignore this hint.
>what do you have to consider when passing Object  instances from one thread to another ?
passing the Object between threads you will pay attention that these Objects are not manipulated by two threads at the same time . an example would be a Map implementation whose key/value pairs are modified by two concurrent threads in order to avoid problems with concurrent modifications you can design an Object to be immutable.
>which rule you have to follow in order to implement an immutable class ?
to make the class immutable there are some rules that can we follow
make all the fields of the class private and final
there should not be a setter methods
the class itself declare final in order to prevent subclass to violate the principle of immutability.
if fields are not of a primitive type but reference to anothr Object
there should not be a getter method that exposes the reference directly to the caller
>what is the purpose of the class java.lang.ThreadLocal ?
As memory is shared between different threads ,ThreadLocal provides a way to store and retrieve values for each thread separately.implementation of ThreadLocal store and retrieve the values for each thread independently
>what are possible use cases for  java.lang.ThreadLocal ?
instances of ThreadLocal can be used to transport information throughout the application withiout the need to pass this  from method  to method example is  that transportation of security/login infromation within an instance of ThreadLocal such that it is accessible by each method
>what is the meanig of scalability ?
Scalability means the ability of a program to improve the performance by adding further resources to it /
>what do you understand by lock contention ?
lock contention occurs when two or more threads are competing in the asquisition of a lock
>which technique help to reduce lock contention ?
the scope of lock is reduced
using hardware supported optimistic locking operations instead of synchronization
avoid synchronization where possible
avoid Object pooling
>what is Object Pooling in java ?
An Object pooling is a collection of particular Object that an Application will create and keep on hand for those situations where each instance is expensive
>explain by an example the technique lock splitting
this technique is a way to reduce the lock contention when one lock is used to synchronize access
>how can we access the thread pool that is used by parallel stream operations ?
ForkJoinPool.commonPool()
>is it possible to perform stream opetation in java 8 with a thread pool ?
collections provide the method parallelStream() to create a stream that is processed by a thread pool.also we can use the paraller() method to convert the sequential stream to parallel stream .
>what is the difference between the two classes RecursiveTask and RecursiveAction ?
>what do you understand by a CAS operation ?
CAS stands for compare-and-swap and means that the processor provides a separate instruction that updates the value of a register only if the provided value is equal to the current value
>what is the difference between two interfaces Executor and ExecutorService ?
The interface Executor only defines one method execute(Runnable) implementation of this interface will have to excute the given Runnable instance at some time in the future.The ExecutorService interface is an extension of the Executor interface and provides additional methods to shut down the underlying implementation to await the termination of all submitted tasks and it allows submitting instances of callable.
>what happens when you submit() a new task to an ExecutorService instance whose queue is already full ?
>what is ScheduledExecutorService ?
The interface ScheduledExecutorService extends the interface ExecutorService ans adds method that allow to submit new tasks to the underlying implementation that should be executed a given poiny in time there are two methods to schedule one shot tasks
>what is the difference between the two interfaces Runnable and Callble ?
The interface Runnable defines the method run() without any return value where as the interface callble allows the method call() to return a value and to throw an exception.
>what is the difference between HashMap and Hashtable with regards to thread-safety ?
>is there a simple way to create a synchronize instance of an arbitary implemntation of collection
yes there is a method that converts the collection .list or Map
into the synchronize instance Collections.synchronizedCollection(Collection)
<what is semaphore ?
semaphore is a data Structure that is used to control how many thread can access a critical section or  resource simultaneously .hence java.util.concurrent.semaphore takes the first parameter the number of permits the threads compete about
//semaphore has two methods take and release methods acquire and release methods
>what is synchronization in respect to multi-threading  in java ?
with respect to multi threading synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources
//Runnable is more advantageous when you are going for multiple inheritance.
//what is native  method in java ? the method is implemneted in native code that is code that does not run in the jvm it is typically  writtern in c or c++ .native methods are  usually used to interface with system  call or libraries writtrn in other programming languages.
>what is the difference between Thread.start() and Thread.run() methods ?
>what is TheadLocal class ?
A thread local variables effectively provides a separate copy of its value for each thread that uses it.Thread Local instances are typically private static fields in classes that wish to associate state with a thread.
>what is InvalidMonitorStateException is thrown ? why ?
this exception is thrown when you try to call wait notify notifyAll any of these methods for an Object from a point in your program where you have not a  lock on that Object this exception is a sublclass RuntimeException so we r not
next()
previous()
hasPrevious()
remove()
nextIndex()
previousIndex()
>what is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList in java collection
frequent insertion and removal of Objects in ArrayList is slower based on the index because elements have to be shifted in the array
where as in the LinkedList Frequent insertion and removal of elements is faster  this is because removal only requires change in the pointer location in the two neighbor nodes which is going to be removed.
search operation is fast in the ArrayList bcz it maintains the index based system for its elements
>what do you mean by fail-fast and  fail-safe property ?
fail fast  property checks for  any modification in the structure of the  underlying collection every time we try to get the next element if collection  is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created
what to do you need to do yo use a custom Object as a key in Collection
reduces the programming efforts due to use code
increased performance because of high-performance implementation
?How hashtable works in java ?
Hashtable uses HashMap to store the elements
private  transient HashMap<E,object> map;
private static final Object present=new Object();
public boolean add(E e)
{
 return map.put(e,present)==null;
}
>what is identityHashMap and WeakHashMap
identityHashMap is same as HashMap
 except it uses the refrence equality  when comparing the elements
WeakHashMap is an implementation of the Map interfsce that stores only weak references to its keys
>how to design a good key for HahsMap
ClassCastException
LinkedList allows fot constant time insertions or removals
>how to make the Collection read only
Collections.unmodifiableCollection()
Collections.synchronized()
>how to avoid the ConcurrentModificationException while iterating a collection
ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList
you can convert the list to an array and then iterate on the array
you can lock the list while iterating by putting it in a synchronized block
>what is unsupportedOperationException ?
this exception is thrown on invoked methods which are not supported by actual collection type.
Collections.unmodifiableList() then call add() method or remove method
>which collection classes provides random acces of its elements?
ArrayList,HashMap,TreeMap,HashTable classes provide random access to

Stream is a sequence of data .in java stream is composed of bytes .it is called a stream because it is like a stream of water that continues to flow
System.out it is a standard output stream
System.in  it is a standard input stream
System.err it is a standard error stream
BufferedOutPutStream class is used for buffering an output stream .it internally uses buffer to store the data . it add more efficiency than to write data directly into stream so it makes the performance fast.
OutputStream=new BufferedOutputStream(new FileInputStream());
BuffereInputStream class is used to read information from stream .it internally uses buffer mechanism to make the performance fast.
when a BufferedInputStream is created an internal buffer array is created
methods of BufferedInputStream class
int available()
int read()
int read(byte[] b,int off,int ln)
void close()
void reset()
void mark()
SequenceInputStream class is used to read data from multiple Streams sequentially(one by one)
java  ByteArrayOutputStream class
this  class is used to write common data into multiple files.in this stream  data is written into a byte array which can be written to multiple Streams later
ByteArrayOutputStream class holds a copy of data and  forwards it to multiple  Streams this class automatically grows according to data
ByteArrayInputStream is used to read byte array as input stream
DataOutputStream class allows  an application to write java data types to the outputStream in a machine independent way.
DataInputStream class is allows an application  to read primitive data  from input Stream in a machine-independent way.
java FilterOutputStream class
this class implements the OutputStream class and it provides the different sub classes such as BufferedOutputStream and DataOutputStream to provide additional functionality so it is less used individually
>what are Byte Streams in java programming language ?
byte streams handle I/O of raw binary data.byte streams represents low level io which which are used for primitive I/O operations
byte stream handle the io of raw binary data  byte streams represents low level  I/O which usually used for primitive I/O
all byte stream classes in java programming language extend from inputStream and OutputStream . some of the classes provided in java programming  language that are based on byte stream are FileInputStream and FileInputStream  and ByteOutputStream
StringBufferInputStream and StringBufferOutputStream which perform byte I/O operations on String ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream which perform byte I/O operations on Objects.
>what are character streams in java programming language ?
Character streams handle the I/O operations of character data  sets .
all the character stream classes in java programming language implements from Reader and writer interfaces. some of the classes provided in java programming language  that are based on character streams are/ InputStreamReader and OutputStreamwriter which are byte to character bridge.
charArrayReader and CharArrayWriter whhich perform byte I/O operations on a char arrays
StringReader and StringWriter which perform character  O/O operations on Strings.FileReader and FileWriter which perform  byte I/O operations on character files.
>what are Buffered streams in java programming language ?
Buffered stream provide buffered functionality to unbuffered  streams by wrapping them .
this is perform I/O operations on buffers and call native OS API when buffer is empty java io follows  decorator pattern by enabling wrapping of one stream with another .unbuffered stream is wrapped  with a buffered  stream to provide buffered I/O operations.java programming language provides  BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream classes that wrap byte streams and  BufferedReader and Bufferedriter classes that wrap character streams.
>what are DataStreas in java programming language
DataStream Provid binary operations on primitive data
>what are Object streams in java programming language ?
Object stream provide I/O operations on objects .Objects  have to be serializable in order for object streams to operate on them  all object streams implements either ObjectInputStream interface or ObjectOutput interface.
java programming language provides two classes ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream that provide object stream functionality.
>what are scanner  in java programming language ?
java programming language provides the Scanner class that enables splitting  of String and primitive data into separate tokens ,based on a delimiter that can be a regular expression.
Scanner breaks its input into tokens using a delimiter pattern  which is by default matches  whitespace .
Scanner class splits its input into tokens using delimiter pattern  which by default matches whitespaces.
A Scanning operation may block waiting for input
A Scanner is not safe for multhreaded use without external synchronization
java.util.Scanner  class
public final class Scanner extends Object implements Iterator<String>
java.io package interview Questions .this package   contains all the required classes and interfaces
java io provides to process the input and produce the output by using the java io package
>how to create file and directory programmatically ?
we can create file by using createNewFile() method and mkdir() methods is to create directory
File f=new File("abc.txt");
f.createNewFile();

f.mkdir();
>what are the FileReader and BufferReader ?
we have 2 ways to read data from the file
FileReader and BufferedReader
by using FileReader we can read data from the file .fileReader contain read() and read(char[] ch) methods to read the  data char by char from  the  file.
BufferedReader:BufferedReader read  the file line by line and it can communicate directly  with the file ,it can communicate  with some reader Object.it is the most enhance reader.
BufferedReader contain the read(), read(char[] ch),close() and readLine() methods
>what are the  FileWriter,BufferedWriter and PrintWriter ?
there are three ways to write  character data into a file
FileWriter BufferedWrirer and PrintWriter methods
FileWriter:if the  specified file is not already available then  this constructor will create that file
write(int ch) to write single character
write(char[] ch) to write characters
write(String s)to write String
flush(): guarantee that total dara should be writtern peoperly to the file including last character
close():to close the String
delete():to delete file or directory
BufferedWriter:to overcome  FileWriter problem we use BufferedWriter to write text data in to the file in this we have one extra  method newLine() to insert a newline BufferedWriter cant communicate directly with the file in this approach we should take newLine() method for  every line so length of the code will be increased.
PrintWriter: to overcome  the  BufferedWriter problem we use PrintWriter to write any type of data into the file.it is a most enhance writer if file not available then we first create the file and then write data into file
there is some extra methods print(char ch) print(int i) print(double d)
print(String s)
print(Boolean b)
>what are the most enhanced writer and  Reader ?
The most enhance writer is PrintWriter and the most reader  is BufferedReader
>what is the purpose of flush() method ?
this method is to guaranty that total data should be written properly to the file incliding last character.
what is the difference between write(100) and print(100) of PrintWriter class?
in the case of writer(100) the corresponding characters 'd' will be written in to the file where as print(100) it written int value 100.
>what is the difference between Reader Writer and input output streams ?
generally we use Reader and Writer to handle data where as we can use input output Streams to handle binary data like images videos file audio etc
we use FileOutputStream to write binary data to the file where as we use FileInputStream to read binary data from the file
>what is the  serialization ?
Serialization is the interface in java.io package ,serialization is used to convert an Object from java form to file supported form or network supported form FileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes are implementing Serialization
>what is Deserialization ?
Deserialization is interface in java.io package it is the process of convertig an Object from  file Supported form or network to java form
FileInputStream and ObjectInputStream classes are implementing Deserialization
>what is the Externalization ?
in serialization ,jvm is performs the all the activities in this case programmer does not have any control  .in this process all the  Objects are save in the file which is creates the performance problem to overcome there problem these problem by using Externalization all the activities perform by programmer.
>what is the use of SerialVersionUID ?
when serialization sender side JVM will generate a unique id based on the .class file and at the time deserialization reciever side jvm will compare that unique id with local class unique id .if both ID's match then deserialization will perform that unique id is SerialVersionUID.
the  stream in the java io package supports many data such as primitives1 Object localized characters etc
>how can you write text to a file ?
FileWriter fw=new FileWriter(filename);

>what is FileInputStream and FileOutputStream in java ?
A FileOutputStream is an output stream  for writing data to a file.
if you have to write primitive values then use FileOutputStream instead for character-oriented data prefer FileWriter but you can write byte-oriented as well character-oriented data .
>what is FileInputStream class ?
A FileInputStream class Obtains input bytes from a file .it is used for reading streams of raw bytes such as image data for reading streams of characters consider using FileReader.
>how many ways can we read data from the keyboard ?
There are many ways to read data from the keyboard
InputStreamReader class
BufferedReader class
Console class
Scanner class
InputStreamReader and BufferedReader class
BufferedReader class can be used to read data line by line by readLine() method
the Console class can be used to get input from the keyboard
there are various ways to read input from the keyboard the java.util.Scanner class is one of them . The Scanner class breaks the input into  tokens using the delimiter which is whitespace by default. it provides many methods to read and parse various primitive values.
InputStreamReader isr=new  InputStreamReader(System.in);
BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(isr);
System.out.println("Enter your name");
String s=br.readLine();
System.out.println("Welcome "+name);

String sname=sc.next();
System.out.println("your roll number is :"+num+"and your   name is "+snme);
>how to delete temporary file in java ?
Temporary file is used to store the less important and temporary data. which sholud always be deleted when your system is terminated . the best practise is use the file File.deleteOnExit() to do it.
File temp=File.createTempFile("abc",".tmp");
 temp.deleteOnExit();
>how to create a temporary file in java ?
creating a temporary file in java is straightforward . there are two static methods names createTempFile in java File class one that takes two arguments and another that takes three arguments i created the test class shown below to demonstrate how to create a java temporary file

we can also create the property files dynamically first create the properties  Object add all property  key value pair by using setProperty() method then write this file to FileOutputStream Object to store is as a property file
java.util.Properties;
>how to store and read Objects  fron a file in java ?
basically to read Objects from a file one should follow these steps :
open FileInputStream to the file that you  have stored the Object to
open ObjectInputStream to the above FileInputStream
use readObject method of ObjectInputStream class to read the Object from the file
the Above  method returns an Object of type Object so you have to cast it to the original type to use it properly
private static final long serialVersionUID=1L;
private String first_name;

>what is a transient  variable in java ?
in java a transient variable is a variable whose value is  not saved  to a stream during serialization.
>what is thread ?
A thread in context of java is the path followed when  executing a programme.
all tha programmes have at least one thread known as main thread which is created by the jvm at the programme  starts.
when the main method is invoked with the main thread
creating the thread is accompolished by implementing the interface or extending the class every threas is created and handled by java.lang.Thread class .when a thread is created it is assigned a priority .the thread with higher priority is executed first followed by lower priority threads
jvm stops executing threads under either of the following conditions
if the exit method has been invoked and authorized by the security manager
and  if all the daemon threads of the progrm have been died.
>what is the difference between microprocessor and microcontroller ?
microprocessor is an IC which has only the cpu inside them only the processing powers such as intel pentium 1,2,3,4 core 2 duo i3,i5,etc
these microprocessor dont have RAM,ROM and other peripheral on the chip
in the  microcontrollers there is a CPU in addition with fixed amount of RAM,ROM and other peripherals all embedded on a single chip.it is also called as a mini computer on a single chip today different manufacturers produce microcontrollers with a wide range of features available in  different versions
the clock speed of the Microprocessor is quite high as compared to the microntroller where as microcontrollers operate from a  few MHz to 30
microprocessor can not be used stand alone  they need other peripherals like ROM RAM buffer io ports  etc and hence a system designed around a microprocessor is quite costly
microcontroller can called as heart of the embeded systems and major microcontroller manufacturer companies are making them to be used in embedded market.
Microprocessor has only a CPU inside them in one or few integrated circuits like microcontrollers it does not have RAM ROM and other peripherals they are  dependent on external circuits of peripherals to work but
von Neumon model where program memory and data memory are separated
Harvard architecture where programme memory and data are stored in same memory module
Thread is  a light weight,sub-process,smallest unit of processing.
multiprocessing and multitasking both are used to achieve multitasking
>what is the difference between Multi-threading and Multi-processing
Multithreading refers to an application with multiple threads running within  a process.while multi processing refers to an application organised across multiple OS level process A thread is a stream of instructions within a process Each thread has its own instruction pointer set of registers and stack memory.
threads are share common memory area they dont allocate separate memory area so saves memoy and context-switching between the  threads takes less time than process.multithreading mostly used in games animation etc.
>what is multitasking ?
multitasking is a process of executing multiple task simultaneously we use multitasking can be achieves by two ways.
>what is the disadvantage of process based multitasking ?
each process have its own address in memory i.e each process allocates separate memory area.
there will be a multipile process inside a OS and one process can have mukltiple threads.
>Thread life cycle
New
Runnable
Running
Non-Running
Dead

New:When we create a new Thread Object using new Operator then the thread is in new Thread .At this point thread is not alive and its
Runnable: when we call the Start() function on Thread Object it is changed to Runnable and control given to Thread schedular to finish execution Thread Schedular picks one thread from the runnable thread pool and change it's state to Running
>what is the join() method ?
the join method is used to hold the execution of currently running thread until the specified thread is dead (finished execution)
there are two ways to create  the threads
by extending the Thread class
by implementing the Runnable interface
>Thread Schedular in java ?
Thread in java is a part of the JVM that decides which thread should run().
there is no guarantee that which runnable thread will be chosen to run by the thread schedular.
only on thread can run at a time in a single threaded process.
Thread Schedular mainly uses preemptive or time slicing to schedule the threads.
>what is preemptive scheduling in java ?
under preemptive scheduling the highest priority task execute until it enters the waiting states or higher priority task comes into existence.
sleep() method in java
public static void sleep(long milliseconds) throws InterruptedException
public static void sleep(long milliseconds,int nanos) throws InterruptedException

we can not start a thread twice if we try to start a thread twice it will throw a IllegalThreadStateException is thrown
>what will hapeen if we call the run() method directly instead start() method
each thread starts  in a separate call stack
calling the run method directly from main method the run() method goes onto the current call stack rather than at the beginning of a new call stack
>what is the join method ?
join method waits for a thread to die in other words it causes the currently running threads to stop executing  until the thread it joins with completes its task.
>what  is the Daemon thread in java ?
Daemon thread is a thread which provides the service to the user thread and it's life depends on the user thread that means when all the user  threads dies jvm terminates this thread automatically/
there are many threads running in jvm automatically like gc,finalizer etc.
java.lang.Thread class provides two methods  for java daemon thread
public void setDaemon(boolean status)
public boolean isDaemon()
java.lang.IllegalStateException
>what is thread pool in java ?
java thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reuse many times
Ram temporary saves the data
PROM: programmable read only memory.
EPROM: erasable and programmable read only memory
EEPROM : Electrically Erasable and programming Read only memory
java Thread Pool saves time because there is no need to create a new thread
thread pool is used in servlet and jsp where container creates a thread pool to process the request.
import java.util.concurrent.*;
ExecutorService ex=Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
{
 Runnable worker=new WorkerThread(""+i);
 ex.execute(worker);
}
 ex.shutdown();
while(!ec.isTerminated())
{
 System.out.println("finished all threads");
Thread Group in java
java provides a convinient way to group multiple threads in a single Object
there is a difference between thread group and thread pool
in thread pool we use the java.util.concurrent.Executors
and java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService
java provides a method to group multiple threads in a single Object in such a way that we can suspend ,resume or interrupt group of threads by a single method call
ThreadGroup(String name) creates the thread group with given name
ThreadGroup(ThreadGroup parent,String name) creates the thread group with given parent group and name.
there are many important methods in a threadgroup class
int activeCount() returns the number of threads running in current group
int activeGroupCount() returns the number of active group in this thread group.
void destroy() destroys this thread group and all its sub groups
String getName() returns the name of this group
ThreadGroup getParent() returns the parent of this  group
void interrupt() interrupts the all threads of this group
void list()
>what is Shutdown Hook ?
ShutDown can be used to perform cleanup resources or save the state when jvm shuts down abnormally or cbruptly.performing clean resources means closing the log file sending some alerts  or something
when user  ctrl+c on the command prompt
System.exit(int) method is invoked
user logoff
user shutdownaddD
addShutdownHook(Thread hook) method
addShutdownHook() method of Runtime class is used to register the thread  with the virtual machine
public void addShutdownHook(Thread hook)
{
}
the Object of runtime class can be Obtained by calling the static factory method getRuntime()
Runtime r=Runtime.getRuntime();
the shutdown sequence can be stopped by invoking the halt(int) method of runtime class.
>difference between normal class and Anonymous class;
A normal class can implement any number of interface but Anonymous calss can implement only one interface at a time
A regular class can extend a class and implements any number of interface simultaneously but anonymous inner class can extend a class or can implement an interface but not both at a time.
for a regular class we can write any number of constructors but
finalize method is define Object class where as gc() method  is define in System and Runtime classes
process is an executing program and one or more threads run in the context of the process
process and threada both are the independent sequence of execution the main difference is that thread run in a shared memory space.while process run in a  separate memory spaces
a thread is a subset of the process .
a process consist of multiple threads thread is a smallest  part of the process that can execute concurretly
synchronization in java is a capability to control the access  of multiple threads to any shared resource .
it is a better option where we want to allow only one thread to access the shared resource.
synchronization is used to prevent thread interface and prevents the consistency problem
there are two type of synchronization
process synchronization and thread synchronization but will discuss only on thread synchronization
there are two type of thread synchronization mutual exclusive and inter thread communication
Mutual exclution means a single thread should be able to acess the shared at any given point of time . this avoids the race conditions between threads acquiring the resource .Monitors and Locks provid the functionality
thread is a type of data which is logically part of an Object Header on the heap memory
each object in java has a lock that any program use to coordinate multi threading access to the object lock
if any thread want to acess the instance variable of that Object  then must own the Object lock (set some flag in memory lock memory area) then all the threads a lock is a part is a kind od data which is logically part  of an Objects header on the heap memory set the flag in lock memory area  lock memory area
what is monitor ?
the ability to make threads wait for certain condition to be true
multithreading  means in any single process multiple threads is allowed and again can run simultaneously,multitasking means sharing of computer resource among processes
multitasking is allow CPU to perform multiple tasks simultaneously where as the multithreading allows multiple threads of the same process to execute simultaneously
in multitasking system has to allocate separate memory and resources to each program that cpu is executing
multitasking allow CPU to perform multiple task simultaneously .to perform multitasking cpu switches among these task very frequently so that user can iteract with each program simultaneously.
multithreading is different from multitasking in a sense that multitasking allows multiple tasks at the same time where as the multithreading allows multiple threads of a single task to be processed by cpu at the same time.
thread is a basic execution unit which has its own program.
multitasking  allocates separate  memory and resources for each process and programs in multithreading threads belongs to a same process shares the same memory and resources as that of the process ,
the thread which is define by extending thread class creates a unique Object and get associated with that Object on the other hand each thread define by implementing Runnable interface shares the same Object.
>what is the difference between Thread and Runnable
in thread class each thread has unique Object and get associated with it where as the in Runnable all the  threads has the same Object associated with
as each thread creates a unique object more memory required in Runnable all the threads share the same Object less memory is used.in java multiple inheritance is not allowed hence after a class extend class it can not extend other class extending thread class introduces tight coupling as the class contains code of thread class and also the job assigned to the thread.
Thread is class in java.lang  package the thread class extends an Object class and it implements Runnable interface
when we create a thread each thread creates a unique Objects and get associated with that Object
Runnable is an interface in java.lang package implementing Runnable  interface we can define a thread .Runnable interface has a single method run() which is implented by the class that implements Runnable interface when you choose to define thread
process is the program execution where as thread is the part of the running process provides an enviroment.a process  can contain multiple threads
executing a program is called process and thread is a small part of the process.every process has its separate address space all the threads of the process share the same address space coopertivley as that of a process.
context switching from one process to another procss is expensive
an executing a program itself is called a process
process is a execution in program  or execution environment provided by the operating system  that has its own set of pruvate resources.
>in java ,what is a process and a thread ?
in java process correspond to a running java virtual machine
>how many threads does a java program hava at leasr ?
each java program is executed within the main thread hance each java application has at least one thread .
each java program executed from the main method hence at least there is only one thread in java program
>what is the purpose of the thread groups ?
each thread belongs to a group of threads JDK class java.lang.ThreadGroup provides some methods to handle a whole group of threads . with these methods  we can for interrupt all threads of a group or set their maximum priority
>what states can a thread  have and what is the meaning of each state ?
new:A thread that has not yet started is in this state.
Runnable:A thread executing in the java virtual mschine is in this state.
>how do we set the periority of a thread ?
the periority of a thread is set by using the method setPeriority(int n)
>how thread is created in java ?
java.lang.Thread class provides two way to create a thread by extending the thread class and implementing the Runnable interface
<how do we stop  a thread in java ?
to stop thread one can use a volatile reference pointing to the current thread that can be sent to null by other threads to indicate the current thread should stop its execution
>why should a thread not be stopped by calling its method stop()
a thread should not be stopped by using the deprecated methods stop() of java.lang.Thread as a call of this method causes the thread to unlock all the monitors it has acquired.
>is it possible to start a thread twice ?
no after invoking the start() method a second invocaion of start() will throw  an IllegalThreadStateExcaption
>what is daemon thread ?
A daemon thread is a servive provides thread to the user define thread.Daemon thread stops executing when all the threads of user is dead.
>is it possible to convert a normal user thread into a daemon thread after it has been started ?
it can't be possible that converting a a user thread into a daemon thread once it start.if we try to convert the user thread into a daemon thread on(True)
java volatile visibility guarantee
in multithreading application where the threads operate on non-volatile variables each thread may copy variable from memory into cpu catch while working on them for performance reasons if your computer contains more than one cpu each thread may run on a different cpu that means that each thread may copy the variables into the cpu cache of different cpus
wait is used for inter-thread communication while sleep is used to introduce pause on execution
wait method along with notify() and notifyAll() methods are for inter thread communication where as sleep method is used to pause the execution of current thread for specific amount of time
calling the wait() method must hold the lock of the  Object on which it is calling wait
>what is cpu cache memory
cache memory is also called random acess memory RAM that a computer microprocessor can access more quickly than
the main purpose of cache memory is that to store the program instructions that are frequently
>how can we prevent busy waiting ?
one way to prevent busy waiting is to put the current thread to sleep for a given amount of time
Thread.sleep(long) is only indication for the schedular how long the current does not need to be executed
InterruptedException
>how should an InterruptedException be handled ?
methods like sleep() and join() throw an InterruptedException
>what is a shutdown hook ?
a shutdown hook is a thread that gets executed when the jvm shuts down it can  be invoking addShutdownHook(Runnable) on the Runtime instance.
the intrinsic lock can be accessed by the same thread again and again
what operations are atomic in java ?
read and write operations to reference variables and primitive  variables
>what is atomic operation ?
atomic operation is an operation that is either  executed completely or not at all.
cache memory is a small and very fast temporary storage memory it used speed up the transfer of data and instruction it is located or indide a cpu chipit is faster than ram the data and instructions are retrieved from RAM when CPU uses them for the first time.a copy of data and instructions is stored in cache the next time data or instruction it first looks in cache  if the required data is found there it is retrieved from the cache memory instead of main memory the cache closet to the cpu is faster smaller and costly and stores the less data then the other level of cache.
>what do we  understand by an atomic operation ?
atomic operation is an operation that is either executed completely or not at all
>what is the difference between sleep(),suspend() and wait() method ?
Thread.sleep() takes the current thread to a "Not Runnable "state for specified amount of time
sleep is the static method taht is used to send the calling thread into a non runnable state for the given duration of time
t.suspend method has been deprecated as it is inherntly deadlock prone
>what happens when i make a static method as synchronized?
Synchronized static methods have a lock on the class so when a thread enters a synchronized static method , the class itself gets locked by the thread monitor no other threand can enter any static
//the lock Object is check is only for synchronized methods or blocks
>what is deadlock ?
deadlock is a condition in which one
when two thread
>what is starvation and what is livelock ?
livelock is occur in a program execute Object.wait(0) on an Object with zero parameters
livelock occurs when all threads are blocked or unable to proceed due to unavailability of required resources
>how to find deadlock has occured in java ? how  to detect a Deadlock in java
java.lang.management package to diagnose and  detect  deadlocks
java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean interface  has two methods which can detect  deadlock  in java application

findDeadLockedThreads():it returns the array of thread id that are deadlocked  waiting on the monitor or
>what is an immutable Object ? how does it help in writing a concurrent application ?
An Object is considered immutable if it's state can not change after it is created.to create an Object immutable you need to make class final and all its member final so that once Objects get created no one  can modify its state
>what is thread dump in java ?
A thread dump is a complete list of active threads .A java thead dump is a way of finding out what each thread in the jvm is doing at a particular pints in time
>what is thread leak  in java ?what does it  mean in java ?
Thread leak in when an application does not release references to a thread Object properly due to this some Threads do not garbage collected and the number of unused threads grows with time application to slow  or hang
>how can i trace whether the application has a thread leak ?
give the unique and deacriptive names to the threads created in the application and add log entry in all thread at various entry  and exit points in threads.change debugging config levels and analyze log messages
>what is thread pool ?
why should we use thread pools ?
A thread pool is a collection of threads on which task can be assigned.instead of creating a new thread for each task. you can pick one thread from the pool and assigned to the task.when the Thread is finished with the task it adds itself to the pool and waits for the another assignment one of common pool is the fixed thread pool this type of pool always has a specified number of threads running
>what is thread Scheduling and Time Slicing ?
Thread Schedular is the operating System service that allocates time to the available runnable threads.when we create and start a thread its execution depends on the implementation of thread schedular time slicing is the process to divide the available cpu time to the available runnable threads
>what is context swithching in multi threading ?
context switching is the process of storing and restoring the cpu state so that thread execution can be resumed from the same poit at a later point of time.Context swithching is the essential feature for multitasking operating system and support for multithreaded environment.
>how does thread communicate with each other ?
when thread shares resources communication between threads is important
>wht thread sleep and yield methods are static ?
these methods work on the currently executing thread so there is no point in invoking thede methods on some other threads that are in wait state that why these methods are
>what is volatile keyword in java ?
when we use volatile keyword  with a variable all the threads its value directly from the memory and dont cache it this make that the value read is the same as in the memory.
>what is ThreadLocal ?
it is used to create the thread local variables. we know that all threads of an object share its variables so the if the variable is not thread safe we can use synchronization but if want to
every thread has its own threadLocal variables and they can use its get() and set()
>what is java Timer class ?How to schedule a task torun after specific interval ?
java.util.Timer is a utility class that can be used to schedule a thread to execute a thread to be
//java language specification guarantees that reading and writinhg a variable is an atomic operation unless the variable is of type long or double .Operations variables of type long or double are only atomic if they declared with the volatile .

you can convert the list to an array and then iterate on the array this approach works well for small or medium size list but if the list is large then it will affect the performance a lot
you can lock the list while iterating by putting it into a synchronized block
you can use ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnwriteArrayList classes
>what is multithreading ?
Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously  threads shares same address space.
thread is a lightweight
cost of communication between threads pocess is low
>what is thread ?
Thread is a lightweight subprocess .it is a separate path of execution .it is called separate path of execution because each thread runs in  a separate stack frame .
if we  start a thread
//daemon thread is basically a low priority threads that provides the background support to the user define  thread it provides services to the user threads.
>what is shutdown hook ?
the shutdown hook is a thread that invokes implicitly before the jvm shuts down we can use it perform  clean up resources.
//if we want to break out the sleep or wait state of a thread.
//Callable interface is a generic parameterized interface
>what is CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch in java ?
//we can use CyclicBarrier by reset() method which resets Barrier to its initial state
//happens before relationship
//race-conditon occurs in a parallel execution of a program by multiple threads at same time
//Thread.uncaughExceptionHandler is an Interface
IllegalMonitorStateException
//synchronize collections locks the whole collection They achieve where concurrent collection does not locks the whole collection like lock stripping  like ConcurrentHashMsp Divides the whole Map into several segements and locks only the relevant segments which allows multiple threads to access other segments of same conucurrentHashMap eithout locking
similarly CopyOnWriteArrayList allows multiple reader threads to read without  synchronization and when a write happens it copies the whole ArrayList and swap with a newer one.
//stack is a memory which is closely associated with thread s.botth are the part of memories in java  application each threads has their own stack variables are stored in the stack memory method parameters and call stack methods stored in one thread stack is not visible to other where as the heap is the common memory area which is shared by all the threads
//memory management in java.
there are three parts in java jvm
young generation
old generation
permanent generation
young generation is a place where newly created Objects are created .when young generation is filled garabage collection is performed this garbage ccollection is called Minor GC young Generation is divided into three parts Eden Memory and two Survivor Memory spaces.
Old generation memory contains the Objects that are long lived and survived after rounds of Minor GC.usually garbage collection is performed in old Generation memory when it is full.old Generation Garbage collection is performed in Old Generation memory when it is full Old Generation Garbage Collection is called Major GC and usually takes longer time.
Stop the world Event
All the Garbage Collection are stop the world events because all application threads are stopped until the operation completes.
since young generation keeps short live objects Minor GC is very fast and application does not get affected by this .
however Major GC takes longer time because it checks all the live Objects Major GC should be minimized because it will make your application unresponsive for the garbage collection duration
Permanent Generation or Perm Gen
Permanent Generation contains the metadata required by the JVM to describe the classes and methods used in the application permanent Generation is not part of java Heap Memory.permanent Gen  conatains Java SE library classes and methods .permanent Generation Objects are garbage collected in a full garbage  collection
java memory model-Method Area
method area is a part of space in Perm gen and used to  store class structure  and code for methods and constructors
Memory pool: Memory Pools are created by the JVM memory manager to create a pool of immutable Objects if .String Pool is a good example of this kind of memory pool memory pool belongs to Heap or Permanent Gen
Runtime Constant Pool :
stack Memory is used for the execution of a thread they contain method specific values that are short lived and references to other Objects in the heap
//java Garbage Collection Types
there are five types of garbage collection strategy  for the application
1>Serial GC
2>Parallel GC
3>Paraller old GC
4>Concurrent Mark Sweep
5>G1 Garbage Collector
//if excaption is not caugh then thread will be die.
The ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList implementations provide much higher concurrency and scalability while preserving the thread  safety with   some minor
>what is the difference between static memory allocation and dynamic memory allocation ?
static memory allocation is a process in which declared variables are allocated memory at compile time most of the declared variables have static memory this kind of assigning the address of a variable to a pointer is known as static memory allocation.
>what is thread pool ? why should you thread pool in java ?
creating thread is expensive in terms if time and resource if you create the thread at time request processing it will slow down your response time also there is a limited number of threads a process can create to avoid these issues a pool if thread is created when application is start up and threads  are reused for request processing this pool of thread is known as thread pool  and threads are known as worker thread  there many thread pool in java .
like single thread pool which process one task at a time fixed thread pool a pool of fixed number of threads cached thread pool an expandable thread pool suitable for application
// Producer Consumer Solution using BLockingQueue in  java
produces consumer problems is one of the classic multithreading problems in computer it is  tricky because it involves inrer thread communication
ArrayLinkedBlockingQueue and LinkedBlockingQueue
BlockingQueue provides a put() methods to store the elements and take() method to retrieve  the element
the main difference between in livelock and deadlock is that in livelock states of the procedded involed in the livelock constantly change with
>how do you check if a thread holds a lock or not ?
there is a  method  in java.lang.Thread class holdsLock() it returns true if and only if the current thread holds the monitor lock on the specified Object
IllegalMonitorStateException throw when they get called from non synchronized context so i said there is  also one method in java thread class that gives an idea  that the current running holds the lock of an Object holdsLock(Object obj) which returns true or false based on wether threads holds a lock on the Object passed
>which parameter of JVM is used  to control stack size of a thread ?
-Xss parameter is used to control stack size of thread in java
>what is ReentrantLock in java ?
ReentrantLock is a concrete implementation of lock interface provided in java  concurrency package  from java reentrant is a mutual exclusive lock similar to implicit locking provided by the synchronize keyword in java.
put() method and Take method
>what is the difference between ReentrantLock and synchronized keyword
the main difference between ReentrantLock and synchronize keyword is that synchronize keyword does not provide fairness
ReentrantLock provides a method tryLock() which acquires lock only if it is available or not held by any other thread this reduce blocking of thread waiting for lock in java application .
ReentrantLock class defines a method tryLock() and lockInterruptibly()
>what is yield method in thread ?
The java.lang.Thread.yield() method causes the currently executing thread Object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute .it is static method with void return type.
>what is the concurrency level of ConcurrentHashMap in java ?
16
>what is semaphore ?
Semaphore is a thread synchronization construct that can be used either send signals between threads to avoid missed signals and guide a critical section
java.util.concurrent.semaphore class is a counting semaphore it has two main methods
acquire()
release()
>what happens when if you submit a task when the queue of the thread pool is already filled ?
ThreadPoolExecutors submit() method throws RejectedExecutionException if the task can not be scheduled for execution
>what is the difference between the submit and execute method thread pool in java ?
both methods are ways to submit task to thread pools but there is a difference between them execute(Runnable command) is defined in Executor interface and executes given task in future but more importantly it does not retyrn anything it's return type is void.
//method of ExecutorService interface submit() with future return object
ThreadPoolExecutor or ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor gets these methods
>what is blocking  method in java ?
blocking method in java is a method which blocks until the task is blocked
>what is the difference between invokeAndWait and invokeLater in java?
>what is Busy spin in multi threading ?
busy spin is a technoque which concurrent programmers employ to make a thread  wait on certain condition
>what is difference between volatile and atomic variable  in java ?
volatile keyword provide you happens before guarantee that write will happen before any subsequent write.it does not guarantee atomicity AtomicInteger class provides atomic  it provides the method getAndIncrement
>What happens if a thread throws an Exception inside synchronized block?
This is one more tricky question for average Java programmer, if he can bring the fact about whether lock is released or not is a key indicator of his understanding. To answer this question, no matter how you exist synchronized block, either normally by finishing execution or abruptly by throwing exception, thread releases the lock it acquired while entering that synchronized block. This is actually one of the reasons I like synchronized block over lock interface, which requires explicit attention to release lock, generally this is achieved by releasing the lock in a finally block.
>what is double  checked locking of singleton ?
>what is fork-join framework in java ?
>when threads are not lightweight process in java ?
threada are light weight process only if threads of same process are execting  concurrently but if threads of different processors are executing concurrently then threads are heavy weight.
>what is race condition in multithreading and how can we solve it ?
when more than one thread try to access same resources with synchronization  causes race condition .
>why wait notify and notifyall are in the Object class and not in Thread class ?
Every Object has a monitor acquiring that monitors allow thread to hold lock on Object but thread does not have any monitors .these methods are called on objects only when method is called on Object
//visual vm is the most popular way to generate thread dump
>why destroy() method is depricted ?
destroy() method is a deadlock prone if the target thread holds a lock and destroy() method is called on the thread then no other thread can lock this Object Deadlock formed are similar to deadlock formed when suspend() and resume methods are called  it results in deadlock formation these deadlock are frozen process .calling destroy() method on threads throw runtimeException  NoSuchMethodError
>as stop() method is depricted ,how can we terminate or stop infinitely running thread in java ?
infinite threads can stop using  boolean variable.
infinitely running thread can be stoped using interrupt() method.
calling the Thread.stop() method causes it to release all of the monitors that it has locked if any of the objects previously protected by these monitors were in an inconsistent state
>what id significance of yield() method .what does it put thread in ?
yield is native method in  java 5 yield method  is used to call sleep() method giving all the threads of same or higher priority to execute
>what is the difference between Object lock and class lock ?
thread can acquire the Object lock by entering synchronize block or by entering the synchronize method.
threads of different objects can enter  same method at same time.
multiple may exist on same or different objects of the class but only one thread can enter static synchronized method at a time
//ThreadPool implementation internally uses LinkedBlockingQueue//
>How to create the threadPool in java ?
ThreadPool threadpool=new ThreadPool(2);
>what is singnificance of using ThreadLocal ?
ThreadLocal is a class which provides threadLocal variables .every thread has  it's own ThreadLocal value that makes ThreadLocal  value threadsafe as well
Creating the ThreadLocal
private ThreadLocal<String> threadlocal=new ThreadLocal<String>();
>what is busy spin ?
when one thread loops continuously waiting  for another thread signal
>what do you mean by thread starvation ?
when thread does not get enough CPU forits execution Thread starvation happens
>what happen if we run a thread twice?
if we run a thread twice then it will thrown java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException
>what is synchronization in respect to multithreading in java ?
synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource at a time .
>what is the difference between Thread.start().run() method ?
start() method is a native method job of start method is that running the run method in a thread if
>when InvalidMonitorStateException is thrown ?
when an Object throws thr wait(),notify(),notifyAll() method outside the synchronized block or synchronize method
>condition  when deadlock is occur ?
when two threads call Thread.join() on each other
when two thread used the nested synchronization to lock two Obects and the blocks lock the same Objects in different order.
>what is starvation ? and what is a liveLock ?
LiveLock: LiveLock occurs when all threads are blocked or otherwise uable to proceed due to unavailability of required resources and the non-existence of any unblock thread to make those resources available
liveLock will in a programme when all threads will executes the Object.wait(0) on an Object with zero parameters programme is live locked  and can not proceed until one or more threads  call Object.notify() or Object.notifyAll() on the relevant Objects when all the threads in a program are stuck in infinite loops.
>how to find a deadlock has occured in java ? How to detect a Deadlock in java ?
java provides mechanism by which can we find the deadlock situation
java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean interface is management interface for the thread system of the java virtual machine it has two methods which can leverage to detect deadlock in a java application
1>findMonitorDeadLockedThreads()
2>findDeadlockedThreads()
//there is no concept of parent child relationship in threads .each and every  thread created is independent of thread who created it
>how exceptions are handled in case of multithreading scenario ? who will handle Exceptions if there is no hanlder ?
AT thread level
each thread have there own Exception handling mechanism and can be caugh and  configure in the
>what do we understand by the term concurrency ?
Concurrency is the ability of the program to execute several computation simultaneously .this can be achieved by distributing the  computations over the available cpu cores of a machine or even over different machines within the same network .
>what is scheduler ?
 A Scheduler is the implementation of scheduling algorithm that manages access of processes and threads to some limited resources like the processor or some I/O main aim of schedular is that load balancing for the available processes threads that gurantees that each process thread get an appropiate time frame to access the request resource excluively.
>how can a java application access the current thread ?
The Current Thread can be access by calling the currentThread() of jdk class java.lang.Thread
java.lang.Thread.state
>what is the purpose of thread groups ?
Each thread belongs to a group of threads JDK class have java.lang.ThreadGroup provides some methods to handle a whole group of Thread
>how do we stop a thread in java ?
To stop a thread one can use a volatile references to the pointing to the current thread that can be set to null by other threads to indicate the current thread should stop its execution
>why should a thread not be stopped by calling its method  stop() ?
a thread should not be stopped by using the deprected method stop() of java.lang.Thread as a call of this method causes thr thread to unlock all monitors it has acquired  if any Object protectd by one of the released lock was in an inconsistent state this  state gets visible to all threads
>what do we understand by the term scalability ?
the term scalability means to improve the performance by adding further resources to it .
>what is ExecutorService ?
java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService interface is a new way of executing tasks asynchrously in the background it is very similar to threadpool
there are three ways of creating Executor Services
1>ExecutorService ex=Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
2>ExecutorService ex=Executors.newFixedThreadpool()
3>ExecutorService ex=Executors.newScheduledThreadPool()
we can check that the ExecutorService task executed successfully
we can use a Future to check the return value
Future future=ex.submit(new Runnable() {
  public void run()
{
  s.o.p();}
});
future.get();

>Advantage of using PreparedStatement
prepare statement helps us in preventing SQL injection attacks because it automatically escapes the special characters
it allow us to execute dynamic query with parameter input
it provides different types of methods like setter  methods to set the input parameters for the query
it uses batch processing methods for executing multiple queries
it helps us to write object oriented code with setter methods
it returns FORWARD_ONLY so we can only move in forward direction

>why we can not override static method ?
because static method is bound with class where as instance method is bound with object.static belongs to  class area where as instance belongs to heap area.

>Access Modifiers in java
there are two  type of midfiers in java :access modifier and non access modifiers.
private,protected,public,default
there are many non-access modifiers such as static abstract synchronized,native,volatile,transient,etc.

Private access modifier: the private access midifier is accessible only within class.if you make any class constructor private you can not craete the instance of that class from outside the class .
Note: a class can not be private or protected except nested class.

Default access modifier: if you don't use any modifier it is treated as default bydefault .the dafault access modifier is accessible only within the package only.

protected access modifier :the protected access modifier is accessible within the package and outside the package but through inheritance only.the protected access modifier can be applied on the data member,method,and constructor.it cant be applied on the class.

Public access modifier: the public access modifier is accessible everywhere .it has the widest scope among all the others modifers.

>what is instance initializer block ?
instance initializer block is used to initialize the instance data member it run runs each time when an Object of the class is created.Derive

>what is blank or uninitialized final variable?
a final variable that is not initialize at the time of declaration is known as blank final variable.

>why we can not override static method ?
because static method is bound with the class where as instace method bound with the Object static belongs to class are and instance belongs to heap area.

//if we overload the static method in java then it is the example of compile time polymorphism here

>what is static binding and dynamic binding in java ?
Connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding.

>what is interface in java ?
An interface in java is a blueprint of a class .it has static constants and abstract methods.The interface in java ia a mechanism to achieve abstraction .there can be only abstract methods in the java interface not method body it is used to achieve abstraction and multiple  inheritance in java.java interface is a IS-A relationship.and it can not be instantiated like abstract class .
in java 8 interface can  have the default and static methods which is discussed later

java compiler adds public and abstract keyword before the interface method ans it adds public static and final keyword before data member

>what is object cloning in java ?
The object cloning is a way to create exect copy of an Object for this purpose clone() method of Object calss is used to clone an object.
java.lang.Coleable  interface must be implement by the class whose object clone we want to create if we do not implement the cloneable interface clone() method genetates cloneNotSupportedException

>what is command line argument in java ?
the java command line argument is an argumet that passed at the time of running the java program.the arguments passed from the console can be recieved in the java program and it can be used as an input.

 public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    System.out.println("your first argument is "+args[0]);
    }

>what are the different oops cocept in java ?
OOPs stands for Object Oriented Programming
Polymorphism
inheritance
abstraction
Encapsulation
Aggregation
Composition
Association

>what is abstraction ?
Abstraction is nothing but the hide the implementation and show only functionality is known as abstraction.

>what is Encapsulation >
Encapsulation is nothing but the  wrapping the code and data into the isngle unit is called as Encapsulation.

>why is main() method static ?
To access a static method class Object is not needed .the method can be accessed directly with the help of class name so program is started jvm search for the class with main method and class it without creating an object of the class.

>what is the difference between static and instance methods ?
instance method belongs to the instance of a class and requires an instance to invoke the .and static methods belongs to class itself and not to any class instance so it does not need a class instance to be invoked .when the jvm invokes a class instance method ,it selects the method to invoked based on the type of the object reference which is always known at run-time.on the other hand when the jvm invokes a static method it selects the method to be invoked based on the actual class of the Object which may only be known at compile time.

>does java supports pass by value or pass by reference ?
java supports only pass by value .and not pass reference the arguments passed as a parameter to a method is mainly primitive data types or objects.for the data type the actual value is passed .java passes the reference by value just like any other parameter .the pointer to the object is passed as value

>can static block throw exception ?
yes static block can throw only runtime exception or  can use a try catch block to catch checked exception.

>what is the difference between abstract class and interface ?
A class is called abstract when it is declared with the keyword abstract.an Abstrace class contains the at least one abstract method .it can also contain n numbers of concrete method an interface can only contain abstract methods.where as the interface can contain the only abstract methods inside .abstract class can have public ,private protected or default variables and also constants in interface the variable is by default public and final .a class extends  only one abstract class but a classcan  implements the multiple iinterfaces .abstract class does not supported multiple inheritance where as abstract class does.if an interface is implemented it is mandatory to implement all of its methods but  if an abstract class is extended it is mendatory to implement all ab

>what are the different types of references in java ?
A normal reference in java is known as a strong reference.  java.lang.ref package defines three other types of refetences soft,weak,and phantom references .
soft reference  can be used to implement a cache ,an object that is not reachable by a strong reference but it is referenced by a soft reference is called .a softly reachable object may be garbage collected at the discretion of the garbage collector .this generally means that softly reachable objects will only be garbage collected when free memory is low but again it is at the discretion of the garbage collector .soft refetence menas keep thid object unless  the memory id needed.

Weak reference :it is used to implement weak maps .an object that is not Strongly or softly reachable but is referenced by a weak reference is called weakly reachable. A weakly reachable object will be garbage collected during the next collection cycle.this behaviour is used in the class java.util.WeakHashMap.the  weak map allows the programmer to put key/value pairs in the map and not worry about the objects taking up memory when the key is no longer reachable anywhere else another possible application of weak references is the string intern pool

PhantomReference: is used to refetence Objects that have been marked for the garbage  collection and have been finalized  but not yet been reclaimed ,an Object that is not strongly softly or weakly reachable but is refereced by a phantom reference is called phantom reachable This allow for more flexible cleanup than possible with the finalization machanism alone

>what is the difference between instanceof and isinstanceof(Object obj)?
instanceof is used to identify whether the Object is of a particular clas type or its subclass but isInstance(obj) is used to identity object of a particular class.

>what is memory leak ?
A memory leak is where an unreferenced object that will never be used again and still hangs around in memory and does not get garbage collected.

>what is OOPS ?
Object Oriented Programming System is the programming technique to write programs based on the real worl Objects.the states and behaviour of an Object are represented as the member variable and methods in oops programming programs are  organized around objects and data rather than actions and logic .

>what is the difference between procedural programming  and oops ?
procedural programming language is based on funcions but object oriented language is based on real world objects.
procedural language gives the importance on the sequence of function execution  but oriented gives importance on states and behaviur of the objects. procedural language exposes the data to the  entire program but Object  oriented language encasulates the data

>what is associtation ?
association  is a relationship between two objects ,

>what is Aggregation ?
it is a special type of  association it is also called as has a relationship if one object contains another object it is considered as aggregation.

>what is composition ?
composition is special type of aggregation also known as restricted  aggregation. if object contains another object and cotained object can not exist without container then this relationship is known as composition.

//Overloaded methods are bonded using static binding in java .which occurs during compile time i.e compiler bind method calls to the actual method .

>why char is preferred over String for Sorting password ?
String is immutable in java and stored in String pool once it is created it stays in the pool until unless garbage collected so even through we  are done with password it is available in memory for loner duration and there is no way to avoid it, its a security problem

>why String is Popular HashMap key in java ?
Since String is immutable its hashcode is cached at the time of creation and it does not need to be calculated again this makes it a great candidate for key in a Map and it is processing is fast than other HashMap key objexcts this is why String is mostly used as Object as HashMap keys.n

>is String a keyword in java ?
String in java is a class String is final which is used to represent the set of characters in java .

>what is Anagram ?
Two strings are called anagrams if they contain same set of characters but in different order.

>why String is declared final or immutable in java ?
>how to check that String contains the unique characte

>what is Exception Handling ?
Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors ad classNotFoundException9

>Exception handling in java with examples.
Exception handling allows programmer to handle the runtime errors caused by exceptions.

>what is Exception ?
An Exception is an unwanted event that interrupts the normal flow of the program.when the exception occures program execution gets terminated is such case we get a system generated error message.

>java inner classes
java inner classes or nested class is a class which is declared  inside the class or interface .we use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place so that it can be more readable and maintainable .Additionaly it can acees all the members of outer class including private data members and methods .

>what are the advanteages of java inner classes ?
nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is it can access all the members of outer class including private.
nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainalble code because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only.code optimization it requires less code to write program.

>what is difference between nested class and inner class in java ?
inner class is a part of nested class .non static classes are known as inner classes .
//there are two type of nested classes
1: non-static also known as inner classes   2: static classes

there are many type of inner classes
member inner classes
anonymous  inner class
local inner class

>what is member classes ?
A non-static class that is declares inside a class but outside the method is called as member class .

>what is Anonymous inner class ?
A class that have no name is known as anonymous inner class .it should be used if you have to override method of class or interface ,in java anonymous inner  class can be created bt two  ways.
using class or using interface .
//rules for local inner class
local variables  cant be private,public or protected
local inner class cant be  invoked from outside the method

>what is nested interface  ?
An interface declared within interface is known as interface.the nested interface are used to group related interface so that they can be east to maintain .the nested interface must be  referred by the outer interface it cant be accessed directly.

>what is exception ?
Exception is an error Event that occures during the execution  of a program and disrupts its normal flow.whenever any error occurs while executing a java program an exception object is created and then JRE tries to find execution handler to find the exception.if suitable handler is found then the execption object is passed to the handler code to process the exception known as catching the exception .java Exception Hanling framework is used to handle runtime  errors only .compile time errors are not handled by exception handling framework.

>what are the Exception Handling keywords in java ?
throw,throws,finally,try catch,

throw: some time we want to create exception object and then throw it to halt the normal proceesing of the program .throw keyword is used to throw exception to the  runtime to handle  it.

throws: when we are throwing any checked exception in a method and not handling it ,then we need to use throws in method in method signature to let caller program know the exceptions that might be thrown by the method the caller method might handle these exceptions or propagate it to its caller methods using throws keyword

>what is synchronized Throwable getCause() method in Exception handling ?
this method returns the cause of  the exception or null if the cause in unknown.

>what is String toString() method in Exception handling ?
this method returns the information about Throwable in String format. the returned String contains the name of Throwable class and localized message.

//catch(IOException | SQLException | Exception )
{
 logger.error(ex);
 throw new MyException(ex.getMessage());
 }

>what is the difference between checked and unchecked Exception in java ?
Checked Exceptions should be handled in the code using the try catch block or else main() method should use throws keyword to let the JRE know  about these Exception that mighy be thrown from the program while unchecked Exceptions are not required to be handled in the program or to mention them in throws clause .

>what is the difference between throw and throws keyword in java ?
throws keyword is used with method signature to declare the exceptions that the method might throw where as throw keyword is used to disrup the flow of program and handling over the exception where as the throw keyword is used to expilicitly throw an Exception

>how to write custom exception in java ?
we can extend Exception class or any its subclass to create our custom exception class.

>what is OutOfMemoryError in java ?
OutOfmemortError in java is a subclass of java.lang.VirtualMachineError

>what is UnsupportedClassVersionError ?
when your java class is compiled from another jdk version and you are  trying to run it from another java version.

>what is the difference between final,finally and finalize in java ?
final and finally are keywords in java where as finalize is the method in java
final keyword is used with class variables and methods in java
when  we use final keyword with class then class can extend, when we use final keyword with vairables then the variable value cant be change once it assign when we use final keyword with method then the method will not be overriden.

>what happens when exception is thrown by the main method ?
when Exception thrown by the main method ,java Runtime terminates the program and print the exception message and stackt trace in system console.
//when main method throws an Exception java Runtime terminates the program and print the exception message and stack trace in the system console.

>what is an Exception ?
An Exception is an abnormal event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program.

>what is the difference between a chacked and an unchecked exception ?
a checked exception must be handled within a try cathc block or declared in a throws clause where as an unchecked exception is not required to be handled nor declare

>what is NoClassDefFoundError ?
when a class loader tries to load the definition of a class and could not find it usually because the  required class files were not found in the classpath.

>what is a Stacktrace  and how does it related to an exception ?
stack trace provides the names of the classes and methods that were called.from the start  of the application to the point an exception occured .
it is very useful debugging tool since it enables us to determin exactly where the exception was thron in the applicatio and the original causes  that led to it.

>what is difference between error and exception ?
errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running
//once a try block throws an exception remaining statements will not be executed control comes directly to catch block

>what is the difference between ClassNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError ?

>what is ClassCastException in java ?
ClassCastException is a RunTimeException which occurs when JVM unable to cast an Object of one type to another type /
//with java 7 for try blocks doing automatic resource management it is allowed not to have both catch and finally

>what is instantiation in java ?
creating the Object of a class using new keyword known as instantiation.
>what is the use of the static method in java ?
static method is first available at class level then instance level and static method gets loaded when the class is loaded and static method can be invoked with class name and only one copy of static method is available for the class and its instances .any variable declared inside static method becomes of nature static .a non static variable can not be used in static context (method).

//anything inside parameter of the method is parameter.

>what is inheritance in java ?
inheritance in java is a process in which Object of subclass acquires all the properties of parent class is known as inheritance. java supports the single level inheritance  and at the time class can only one super class and java does not supports the multiple inheritance

>what is array in java ?
Array in java is an Object which have a container inside it which holds the collection of similat objects. java.lang.Arrays class  which represents array

>what is hashCode() method in java ?
>what is collection ?
Colletion can be considered as a container in an Object which hold hetrogenous data and makes it easier for adding  removing and manipulating the data.
in collection the size is dynamic while in array is of fixed size .all the classes and interfaces required to work with collection API are in  java.util package. Collection is the base interface of all the Collections .the mai reason of using the collection API is that it provides the lot of utility methods and Collection API is preferred to work with Object not with primitive and variables.

>what is hashCode() method in
hashCode method of Object class is indicate that some other Object is equal to this one.

//Servler API
The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages represents interfaces and classes for servlet api .
The javax.servlet package contains many interfaces and classes that are used by the servlet and or web container these are not specific to any protocol.
javax.servlet.http package contains interfaces and classes that are responsible for http request only .

>java date  conversion .
there are two classes for formatting in java .DateFormat and SImpleDateFormat.
in java converting date into string is called formatting and vice-versa ,formatting means date to string and parsing means string to date.
java.text.DateFormat class provides methods to format and parse date and time in java in language
java.text.Format is the parent class and and java.text.SimpleDateFormat is the subclass of  the java.text.Format class.
//formatting means converting date to String and Parsing means converting String to date.


                     Date Conversion in java

there are two classes for formatting Date in java  , DateFormat and SimpleDateFormat, the java.text.DateFormat class provides many methods to format and parse date and time in java , java.text.DateFormat is an Abstract class. java.text.Format is the parent class and java.text.SimpleDateFormat class is the subclass of java.text.DateFormat class.
NOTE: converting date into String is called formatting while converting String into Date is called as parsing.

//          SERVLET INTERVIEW QUESTION ANSWER   //

>what is difference between server and application servet ?
A web server reponsibility is to handler HTTP request from client browser and respond with HTML response .A web server understand HTTP language and runs on HTTP protocol.Apache web server is a kind of web server and then we have specific containers that can execute servlets and jsps known as servlet  known as servlet container for example Tomcat.Application servers provides additional features such as Enterprise  javaBeans support JMS Messaging support,Transaction Management etc se we can say that application server is a web server with additional functionalities to help developers with enterprise applicaton .

>what is idempotent in java ?
if methods are writtern in such a way that repeated calls to the same method do not cause duplicate updates the method is said to be idempotent.

>which HTTP method is non idempotent ?
A HTTP method is said to be idempotent if it returns the same result every time .HTTP methods GET ,put,delete,head .and options are idempotent methods and we should implement our application to make sure these methods alaways return same result .HTTP method post is non idempotent method and we should use post method when implementing somthing that changes with every request.to access html page or image we should use GET because it will always return the same object but if we have to save customer information to database we should use post method .idempotent mrhtods are also known as safe methods and we dont care about the repetitive request from the client for safe methods.

>what is the difference between GET and POST methods ?
GET is a safe method (idempotent) where POST is non-idempotent method. we can send limited data to with get method and it is snet in  the header request URL where as we can send large amount of data with post because it is part the body.
get method is not secure  because data is exposed in the URL and we can easily bookmark it and send similar rquest agian where as post is secure because data is sent in request body and we cant bookmarked it
get is the default http method where as we need to specify method as POST to send request with post method.Hyperlinks in a page uses GET method.

what is MIME Type  ?
The "Conten-Type" response header  is known as MIME type. server send s MIME type to client to let them know the kind of data it is sending it helps client in rendering the data for user some of the mostly used mime  types are text/html tex/xml application .etc we can use ServletContext getMimeType() method to get the correct MIME type of the file and use it to set the response content type .it is very useful in downloading file through servlet from the server.

>what is the web application and what is it's directory structure ?
web applications are modules that runs on the server to provide both static and dynamic content to the client browser. apache web server supports PHP and we can create web application using pHP .java provides web applicaton support through servlets and jsp that can run in a servlet that can run in a servlet container and provide dynamic content to the client browser.

>what is servlet ?
java servlet is server side technology to extend the capability of web servers by providing support for dynamic respponse and data persistence.
javax.servelt and javax.servlet.http packages provides interfaces and classes for writing our own servlets .all servlets must implement the javax.servlet interface which defines servlet life cycle methods .when implementing the javax.servlet interface which defines servlet life cycle methods when  implementing a generic service we can extend the GenericServlet class provided with the java servlet API the http servlet provides methods such as doGet() and doPost() for handling HTTP specific services.

>what are the advantages of sevlet over CGI ?
Servlet provides the better performance that CGI in term of processing time .memory utilization becuase servlets usess multithreading and for each request a new thread is created that is faster than loading cteating new Object for each request with CGI.
servlets are robust because container takes care of life cycle of servlet and we dont need to worry about memory leak security .garbage collection

>what are common tasks performed by servlet container ?
servlet containers are also known as web container such tomcat
Communication Support:servlet containet provides easy way of communcation between web client and the servlets and jsps because of servelt container we dont need to build a server socket to listen for  any request from client.
servlet container manages the life cycle of servlet from loading of   servlets into memory .initializing servlets invoking servlets mehods and to destroy them container also provides utility like JNDI for resource pooling and management.servlet container supports the multithreading since for each request container creates the new thread for every request to the servlet and provide them request and response objects to process so servlet are not initializes for each request and saves  time and memory .
servlet containet supports the jsp .jsp compiled by the container and conveted to servlet and then container manages them like other servlets.

>what is ServletConfig Object ?
javax.servlet.ServletConfig is used to pass configuration information to servlet.each servlet has its own Servletconfi object and servlet container is responsible for instantiating this object we can provide servlet init parameters in web.xml file or thorugh use of webInitParam annotation we can use getServletConfig() method to get the servletConfig() Object of the servlet.

>what is the difference between servletconfig and servletContext ?
servletConfig is a unique Object per servlet where as  ServletContext is a unique Object for complete application .
servletConfig is used to provide init parameter to the servlet where  as ServletContext is used to provide applictation level init parameters that all other servlets can use.
we can't set attributes in  servletConfig Object where as we can set attributes in servletContext that other servlets can use in theie implementation .

>what is Request Dispatcher ?
RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward the request to another resources .we can also use this to include the content of another resources to the response .this interface is used for inter-servlet communication in the same context there are two methods in this interface

public void forward(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res) forwards the request from a servlet to another resources on the other server

public void include(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res):includes the content of a resources in the response ,we can get RequestDispatcher in a servlet using servletContext getRequestDispatcher(String str)method .the path must begin with a /and is interpreted as relative to the current context root.

>what is the difference between PrintWriter and ServletOutputStream ?
PrintWriter is a character-stream class where as ServletOutputStream is a byte-stream class. we can use PrintWriter to write charcater based information  such as character array and String to the response where as we can use servletOutputStream to wirte byte array data to the response.

// void init(FilterConfig paramFilterConfig): when cotainer initializes the Filrer .this is the method that gets invoked  .this method is called only once in the life cycle of  filter and we should  initialize any resources in this method .FilterConfig is used by container to provide init parameters and servlet context objects to the filter.we can throw  ServletException in this method.

doFilter(ServletRequest paramRequest,ServletRespponse paramServltResponse, FilterChain paramFilrerChain): this is the metod  invoked  every time by container when it has to apply filtr to a resource .Container provides request and response  object references to filter as argument .filterchain is used to invoked the next filter in the chain this is a great example of as a argument. FilterCahin is used to invoked the next filter in the chain

//Servlet WebFilter annotation .
javax.servlet.annotation.WebFilter was introduce in servlet 3.0 and we can use this annotation

what is pure servlet ?
pure servlet is servlet which is used to create java objects that can be implemented from javax.servlet.servlet interface

// JSP (JAVA SERVER PAGES )
jsp technology is used to create web application just like Servlet technology. jsp is an exteension to a servlet because it provides more functionality than servlet such as expression language etc
a JSP page consist of HTML tags and jsp tags .the jsp pages are easier to maintain than servlet because we can separate designing and development it provides some additional features such as expression language custom tag etc.


>what is JSP Action tags  ?
there are many JSP action tags or elements .each JSP action tag is used to perform some specific tasks .
the action tags used to control the flow between pages and to use java Bean the jsp action tags are given below

>what is MVC in jsp ?
MVC stands for Model View Controller. it is a design pattern that separates the business logic presentation logic and data .

// Jsp technology is used to create web application just like servlet technology it can  be though of as an extension to servlet because it provides more functionality than servlet such as expression language custom tags etc .Jsp is an extesnsion of Servlet we can use all the features of servlet in jsp in addition to we can use implicit Objects ,predefine tags ,expression language and custom tags in jsp that makes jsp development  easy.

jsp can be easily manage because we can separate our business logic with presentation logic .in servlet technology we mix our business logic with the presentstion logic.
jf Jsp page is modified we dont need to recompile and redeploy the project .the servlet code needs to be updated recompiled if we have to change the look and feel of the application .
//there is a two package in jsp technology
1: javax.servlet.Jsp
2: javax.servlet.Jsp.tagext

javax.servlet.Jsp package has two interfaces and one 6 classes
JspPage and HttpJspPage are the two interfaces of the javax.servlet.Jsp package where as there is are 6 classess of javax.servlet.Jsp.tagext
jspWriter
pageContext
jspFactory
jspEngineInfo
jspException
jspError

jspPage interface has two methods of jsp life cycle
public void jspInit() and public void jspDestroy()
jspInit() method called only once in the life cycle of jsp it is used for initialization where as public void jspDestroy() method is invoked only once during the life cycle of the jsp before the jsp page  is destroyed .it can be used to perform some clean up operatipon.

The HttpJspPage interface has only one jsp life Cycle Method .and it exntens the jspPage interface
public void _jspService() method is invoked each time when request for the jsp page comes to the container it is used to process the request the underscore signifies that you can not override this method .

>what are the Scripting Elements of Jsp ?
jsp Scripting Elements are used  to write servlet code inside jsp.
there are three scripting elements in the Jsp
1:Scriplet tag  <%      %>
2:Expression tag <% =   %>
3:Declaration tag <%!   %>

//JSP Scriplet tag :in JSP ,java code  can be written inside the jsp page using the Scriplet tag.
Scriplet tag
Expression tag
Declare tag

JSP expression tag
The Code palced within JSP expression tag is written to output stream of the response .so we do not need to write  out.print() to write data it is mainly used to print the values of varialble or method.<% =   %>

Jsp declaration tag:
The JSP declaration tag is used to declare fields and methods the code written inside the declaration tag is used placed outside the service() method of auto generated servlet.
<% !   %>

>what are the implicit Objects  ?
there are total 9 implicit Objects are created by the web container that are available to all the jsp pages
out
request
response
config
application
session
pageContext
page
exception
error

>what is JSP config  implicit Object ?
this Object can be used to get the initailization parameter for a particular JSP page.The config Object is used to get the initialization parameter for the particular jsp

>JSP application implicit Object ?
In JSP ,application is an implicit Object of type ServletContext
the instance of servletContext is created only once by the web container when application or project is deployed on the server the Object can be used to get the initialization parameter from configuration file it can be used to get set or remove attribute from the application scope.

>what is JSP directives ?
the jsp directives are the messages that tells the web container how  to translate a jsp page into the corresponding servlet .there are three directives in the jsp page directive , include directive and taglib directive
<%@  directive attribute="value"%>
the page directive defines the attributes that apply to an entire page.
there are many attributes of page directives in the jsp
import
contentType
extends
info
buffer
language
isELIgnored
isThreadSafe
autoFlush
session
pageEncoding
errorPage
isErrorPage

>what is isELIgnored attribute of the page directive ?
we can ignore the Expression Language (EL) in jsp by the isELIgnored attribute by default its value is false expression Language is enabled by default we see Expression Language later

>what is jsp include directory ?
the include directive is used to include the contents of any other resource it may be jsp file html file or text file the include directive  includes the original content of the included resource at page translation time .the jsp page is translated only once so it will be better to include static resource

>JSP Taglib directive ?
The JSP taglib directive is used to define  a tag library that defines many tags.we use the LTD (tag library discriptor) file to define tags .in the custom tag section we will use this tag so it will be better to learn

>what is JSP Action Tags ?
There are many JSP action tags or elements .each JSP action tag is used  to perform some specific tasks.
the action tag is used to control the flow between the pages and to use java Bean .the JSP action tags are given below

jsp:forward
jsp:include
jsp:useBean
jsp:setProperty
jsp:getProperty
jsp:plugin
jsp:param
jsp:fallback

>what is Expression language ?
The Expression language simplifies the accessibility of data stored in the java Bean component and other Objects like request,response,session ,application.

>what is MVC in JSP ?
MVC stands Model View Controller .it is a design pattern that separates the business logic ,presentation login and data/
in the web application programming language.
we use servlet as a controller,jsp as a view and java bean class as model

>what is JSP ?
JSP stands for JavaServerPages .JSP is java server side technology to create dynamic web pages .JSP is an Extension of Servlet technology to help developers create dynamic pages with html like syntax.we should avoid business logic in JSP pages and try to use it only for view purpose .jsp Scripting elements can  be used for writing java code in JSP pages but it is best to avoid them and use Jsp action elements .JSTL tags or custom tags to achieve the same functionalities.

>what are the JSP lifeCycle phases ?
JSP container takes care of translating the jsp pages and create the servlet class that is used in web application .
Translation:JSP container checks the JSP  page code and  parse it to generate the servlet source code.

Compilation :JSP container compiles the jsp class Source code and produce class file in this phase.

Class Loading:Container loads the class into the memory in this phase.

Instantiation :Container invokes the no args constructor of generated class to load it into memoey and instantiate it.

Initialization :Container invokes the init method of jsp class object and initializes the servlet config eith iniy params configured in deployment descriptor.after this phase jsp is ready to handle client request .usually from translation to initialization of JSP happens when first request for JSP comes but we can ci=onfigure it to be loaded and  initialized at the time of deployment like servlet  using the load on start up element.

Request Processing: this is the longest lifecycle of jsp page and jsp page processes the client request .the processing is multi-threwded and similar servlets and for every request a new thresd  is created snd servletRequest and ServletResponse Object is created and JSP service mehtod is invoked.

Destroy: this is the last phase of JSP lifecycle where JSP class is unloaded from the memory usually it happens when application is undeployed or the server is shut down

>what are the different types of comments in JSP ?
JSP pages provide  two types of comments that we can use.
HTML comment:since JSP  pages are like HTML we can use HTML comments like <-- HTML --> these are sent to client and we can see it in HTML source .so we shiuld avoid any code level comments or debugging comments using HTML comments.
JSP Comments:JSP Comments are writtern using scriplets like <%--JSP Comment --%>.these comments  are  present in the generated servlet source code and doesn't sent to the client ,for any code level or debugging information comments we should use jsp comments.

>what are JSP implicit Objects ?
JSP implicit Objects are created by container while translating jsp page to servlet source to help developers .we can use these Objects directly in Scriplets  that goes in service method .however we cant use them in JSP declaration because that code will go to clss level.

>how can we disable java code or scripting in jsp page?
we can disable scripting element in jsp page through deployment descriptor configuration
<jsp-config>
 <jsp-property-group>
   <url-pattern>*.jsp</url-pattern>
   <scripting-invalid>true</scripting-invalid>
 </jsp-propery-group>
</jsp-config>

>how can we handle exceptions thrown by jsp service method ?
<error-page>
 <error-code>404</erroe-code>
 <location>/error.jsp</location>
</error-page>

<error-page>
 <exception-type>java.lang.Throwable</exception-type>
 <location>/error</location>
</error-page>

>what is the requirement of a tag library ?
A collection of custom tags is called a tag library .

>define composition ?
Composition has a stronger relationship with object than Aggregation.

>what is jsp directives ?
JSP directives are the messages to the jsp engine .they serve as a message from to contain

>what is client and server side validation ?
javaScript is used for the client side validation .it takes  place within the browser

>what is Translation Phase ?
JSP engine  translate and compiles s jsp  file to a servley .this servlet moves to the execution phase where  request and  response is handled .

>how can you avoid scriplet code in jsp ?
using javaBeans or Custom Tags can beused  instead of scriplet code.

//whenever a jsp page is about to be destroyed ,the container invokes the jsp Destroy() method from the javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage interface

>Explain the <jsp:param> action.
it is an action used within include or forward standard actions .it helps in passing the parameter names and values to a resource .

>how to disable scripting ?
Scripting can be easily disabled by setting scripting-invalidate in element of the deployment descriptor to true.it is a sub element of property group it can be false as well as

>how HTML output can be prevented from being cached ?
<%
  response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-store");
  response.setDateHeader("Expires",0);
%>

>what is JSP ?
jsp is a JavaServer Pages is a technology for developing webpages that support dynamic content which helps developers insert java code in HTML pages by making use of special JSP tags  most of start with <%   %>

>what are advantages of using JSP ?
JavaServer Pages are built on top of the java Servlets  Api so like Servlets JSP also has access to all the  power

>what are the advantages of JSP over JavaScript ?
javaScript can generate HTML dynamically on the client but can hardly interact eith the web server to perform complex tasks like database access and image processing etc.

>what are the advantages of JSP over Static HTML ?
Rugular HTML can not contain dynamic information .

>what are the jsp comments ?
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8" %>
<%@ page import="java.util.Date" %>

<%-- this is an JSP comment --%>

>what are the JSP comments ?
JSP comment marks  the text or statements that JSP container should ignore.A jsp comment is usefuk when you want to hide or comment out part of  your jsp page.

>what are the jsp directives ?
jsp directives are the message to the jsp container  that how to convert jsp code into corresponding servelt.

>what are the JSP actions ?
JSP actions use construct in XML syntax to control the behaviour of the servlet engine .you  can dynamically insert file ,reuse javaBeans components ,forward the user to another page or generate HTML for the java plugin <jsp:action_name attribute="value"/>

>what are JSP implicit Objects ?
JSP implicit Objects are the java Objects that the jsp container makes available to developers in each jsp page and developer can call them directly without explicitly declared  jsp implicit Objects are also called pre-defined variables.

how can you read a request header information ?
using getHeaderNames() method of HttpServletRequest to read the HTTP header information .this method returns the Enumetation that contains the header information associated with the current HTTP request.

>what are the Cookies ?
Cookies are the textual information stored on the client computer and they kept for various information tracking purpose

>How Cookies Works ?
Cookies are usaually set in an HTTP header

>is it possible for one JSP to extend another java class if yes then how ?
it is possible  we  can extends another JSP using <%@ page extends="classname"%>
javax.servlet.jsp.HttpJspPage interface

>how can one JSP Communicate with Java file ?
usin import tag  of page directive we can Communicate one JSP file with java  file

>why is _jspService() method starting with an _ while other  life cycle methods do not ?
by default whatever content we write in our jsp page will go inside the _jspService() method by the container if again will try to override this method JSP compiler will give error but we can override other two life cycle method as we have implementing this two in jsp so making this difference cotainer use _ in jspService() method and shows that we  cant override this method .

>what is the need of tag library ?
tag library is a collection of custom tags .Custom actions helps recurring tasks will be handled more easily thay can be reused across more than one application and increase productivity .jsp tag libraries are used by web application designers who can focus on presentation issues of the popular tag libraries are apache display tag library and String tag libaray .you can also check my

>what are the advantages of JSP over Servlet ?
JSP is a Server side  technology to make content generation a simple appear .the advantage of JSP is that it is a document-centric .servlets

>what JSP lifecycle methods can override developer ?
we cannot override the _jspService() method within a jap page but we can override the jspInit() and jspDestroy() methods of jsp page.jspIni() method  can be useful for allocating resources like databases connections ,network connections and so on,

>what are the JSP standard actions ?
The Jsp satandard actions affect the overall behaviour of a JSP page and also the response sent back to the client.

>what is the difference between pageContext.include and jsp.include ?
the <jsp:include> and pageContext.include() methods are used to include the resources at runtime .but there is a difference is that pageContext.include() method always flushes the output of the  current page before including the other components where as <jsp:include> flushes the output of the current  page only if the value of flush is explicitly set to true as follows.

>what do you meant by the Hidden Comment in the JSP context ?
Hidden comment is the code  that doesn't appear in the generated HTML of the JSP page .The JSP engine ignores it completely and discards any code if lying inside the hidden comment
it is useful in the cases where you dont want to show or comment out the sections in the JSP pages. using hte closing symbol in the hidden comment isn't  permissible though you can use it by escaping it after typing.

>is it not advisable to create HttpSession in a JSP .if yes then why ?
JSP files generate the HttpSession by default .this  behavoiur is perfectly as per the j2ee design guidlines ,but dont use the HttpSession in the JSP then you can reduce  the performance overhead by employing the jSp page directive the JSP page directive as given below
<%@ page session="false"%>

>what would you do for printing thestack trace in a JSP page ?
Stack trace helps to analyze a problem better while debugging  the jsp code .it can guide a  web deceloper to identify the method which produced the exception and isolate the source of  that method
<%@ page isErrorPage="true"%>
<%
 out.print(" ");
 PrintWriter pw=response.getWriter();
 exception.printStackTrace(pw);
 out.print(" ");
 %>

>how HTML output can be prevented from being cached ?
<%
  response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-store");
  response.setHeader("Pragma\","no-cache");
  response.setDateHeader("Expires",0);
%>

>what is the difference between ServletContext and PageContext.? and how to create request.getRequestDispatcher() and context.getRequestDispatcher().
The ServletContext provides theinformation about the container.where as PageContext provides the information about the  Request
to create request.getRequestDispatcher(path) we have to provide the  relative path of the resource where as to creatr context.getRequestDispatcher(path) we have to provide the absolute path of the resource.

>how to pass  the information from the Jsp to the include  Jsp ? what is the difference between directive include and jsp include ?
we can pass the information from one jsp to another jsp using <%jsp:param> tag
during passing the information <%@ include > may be used for including the static resources
during translation time the JSP include is used for including the dynamic programming
directive include is used for including the non-jsp file content or static contents during runtime.

>what are the advantages of JSP ?
JSP is an embedded java code in HTML pages
JSP is platform independent
JSP creates the database driven web applications
JSP enables server side programming capabilities.

>what do you mean by JSP p/p Comments ?
JSP Output Comments are visible in HRMl source file

>what is the use of printwriter class in servelt and jsp ?
PrintWriter class is used to print text data to character stream .getwriter returns a printwriter Object can send character text to client .in this case the servlet binded wtirh

// http://localhost:8080/MyWebApps/s5

>what is filters in servlets ?
A filter  is an Object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource or on the response from a resiurce or both .Filters performs filtering in the doFilter method

>what is JVM ?
JVM is an abstract machine .it is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed .
mostly in other programming languages compiler produces code for a particular system but java compiler produces Bytecode for a java virtual machine.java is called platform indepnedent because of java virtual machine. when we submit a .class file to any operating  system .jvm interprets the bytecode into machine level language.

>what is JRE ?
JRE is an acronym for java Runtime Environment .it is  used to provide runtime environment it is the implementation of JVM it physically exists it  contains set of libraries + other  files that jvm uses at runtime .

>what is JDK ?JDK is an acronym for  java Developer kit it physically exist it contains JRE + development tools

//JVM is the main component of java architecture  and it is the  part of the JRE .A program of JVM is written into C programming language and JVM is Operating System dependent. JVM is responsible to allocate the necessary memory needed by thr java program

>what is Garbage Collection ?
Garbage Collection is the  process of reclaiming the unuse memory whic are allocated by the Object whch are no longer  the part of the application .

>are there are any disadvantages of Garbage Collection ?
yes ,whenever the garbage collector runs it has an effect on the  application performance .this is because all other threads in the application have to be stopped to allow the garbage collector thread to effectively do its work .

>what is stack in java memory management  ?
the Stack is a part of memory that contains information about nested method  calls down to the current position in the program .it also contians all local variables and references to Object on the heap defined in currnetly executing mehtods .

>what is generational garbage collection and what makes it a popular garbage collection approach ?
Generational garbage collection can be loosely defined as the strategy used by the garbage collectoe  where the heap is divided  into a number  of sections called generations .each of which hold Objects according to their age on the heap.whenever garbage collector running the first step in the process is called marking .this is where the garbage collector identifies which piece of memory are in use and which are not .this can be a very time consuming process if all Objects in a system must be scanned.as more and more Objects are allocated the list of Objects grows leading to longer and longer garbage  collection time  however .with generational garbage collection Objects are grouped according to their age in terms of how many garbage collection cycles they have survives .this way the bulk of the work spread across various minor and major collectoin cycles .today almost all the garbage collectors are generational .this strategy is so popular because  over time it has proven to be  the optimal solution .

>when does an Object become eligible for garbage collection ?Describe how the GC collection an eligible Object ?
An Object become eligible for Garbage Collection of GC if it is not reachable from any live threads or by any static references.most of the time an Object becomes eligible for garbage collection when all the  references are null.

>How do you trigger  garbage  collection from java code ?
as java programmer ,we can not force garbage collection in java  .it will trigger if jvm thinks it needs a garbage collection based on java heap size before removing an Object from memory garbage collection thread invokes finalize() method of that Object and gives an opportunity to perform any sort of clean up required .we can also invoke this method of an Object code however there is no guarantee that garbage collection will occur when

>what is collection ?
Collection Framework is a simplified archietecture to work with collection
 collection is a root level interface of the java collection framework .most of the classes in java collection framework inherit from this interface .list,set,Queue arw the main sub interfaces of this interfaces .JDK does not allow direct implementation of this interface but provides direct implementatio of ites sub interface .ArrayList,Vector are some indirect implementation of collection interface.
 all the operation that we can perform on data such as searching,sorting,insertion etc can be performed by java Collections.
 collection in java Framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of Objects .
 java collection provides many interfacess(List ,Set Queuedeque etc) and classes (ArrayList ,Vector ,Linked List etc) collection means Single unit Of Objecs i.e group

>what is Collections ?
Collections is an utility class in java.util package .it consist of only static methods which are used to operate on Object of type Collection it has methods to find the maximum element in a collection

>what is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList ?
ArrayList is uses dynamic array to store the elements while LinkedList Uses doubly linked list to store the elements .
manipulation of ArrayList is slow because it internally uses array.if elements remove from the arry all the bits are shifted in memory while manipulation in linkedList is fast than ArrayList because it uses doubly linked list so no bit shift is required in memory. ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data while LinkedList is better for manipulating data

>what is ListIteratoe interface in collection ?
ListInterface is the subinterface of Collection .it contains methods  to insert and  delete elements in index basis. ListInterface is used to traverse the element in backward and  forward direction.

>what is HashSet class ?
java HashSet class is used to create a collection that used a hash table for storage .it inherits the  AbstractSet class and implements the set Interface .hashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing. HashSet contains unique elements only .

>java HashTable class in java ?
A HashTable is an array of list Each list is known as bucket .the position of bucket is defined by calling hashCode() method .A hashTable contains values based on the table.

>what is Comparable  interface ?
java Comparable  interface is used  to order the Objects of user-defined class.this interface is found in java.lang package and contains only one method named compareTo(Object). it provides the single sorting sequence only.we can sort the elements on based on single data member only

>what is java Comparator interface ?
this interface is used in java.util.package and  contains 2 methods comapre and equals .it provides multiple  sorting sequence i.e you can sort the element on the basis of any data member

//Collections.SynchronizedCollection()
  Collections.unmodifiableCollection()
  UnsupportedOperationException
  ClassCastException

//Generic does not supports sub-typing because it will cause the issue in achieving type safety thats why

>what is exception ?
Exception is an error or event that can happen during the execution of a program and disrupts its normal flow .

>what is JRE ?
JRE acronym for java runtime environment .it is used to provide runtime environment .it is the implementation of jvm .it physically exists .it contains set of libraries and other files that jvm uses at run time .

>what is Program Counter ?
PC register .it contains the address of the java virtual machine instruction currently being executed

>what is classLoader ?
ClassLoader is the subsystem of JVM that is used to load classes and interfaces ,there are many types of classLoaders.Bootstrap classLoader.Extension ClassLoader.System ClassLoader  plugin Class lOader.

>what is composition ?
Holding the reference of the other class within some other class is known as composition .

>what is Associtation ?
Associtation is the relation between two classes which establishes through their Objects

>what is abstraction ?
abstraction is a process  of hiding the implementation and details and showing only functionality to the user is call abstraction.

>what is abstraction ?
abstraction in java is a blueprint of a class .it has static constant and abstract methods . the interface in java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction

>what is Exception Handling in java ?
The  Exception handling is java is a process of handling the runtime errors  so that normal flow of the application can be maintained.
Exception handling  is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as

//all the wrapper classes and  string classes are immutable .we can also create the immutable class  by creating the class final that have final data members as the example
>what is the purpose of the System class ?
the purpose of the System class is to provide access to system resource.

>what is javaBean ?
javaBean are reusable software components writtern in the java programming language .design to be manipulated  visually by a software development environment likd

>what does Class.forName() method do ?
A call to Class.forName(x) causes the class name x to be dynamically loaded (at runtime).a call to forName("x") causes the class named x to  be initialized ( jvm executes all its static block after class loading )
Class.forName() method returns the class Object associated with the x class. the returned
Class.forName("x") loads the class if it not already loaded .jvm keeps the track of all the classes that have been previously loaded .this method uses the classLoader of the class that invokes it.the x is the fully qualified name of the desired class.

>what is the use of ByteArrayOutputStream Class ?
java ByteArrayOutputStream class is used to write the common data to multiple file .in this stream the data is writtern into a byte array which can be writtern to multiple streams later.

>java ByteArrayInputStream class is used to read  byte array as input Stream .

>what is DataInputStream class in java io ?
java dataInputStream Class is used to read java primitives from  an inputStream instead of only raw bytes . we can wrap the inputstream in a DataInputStream and then we can read java primitives from the DataInputStream .that is why it is called DataInputStream .because it reads  data instead of just bytes .

//java DataOutputStream class allows an application to write primitive java data types to the  output stream in a machine-independent way.
//java DratInputStream class is allows an application to read primitive data from the input stream in a machine independent way. java application generally used the data output Stream to write data that can later be read by a data input stream .

>java writer class is the base class for all the writer subclass in java IO API.writer is like an OutputStream except that it is character based rather than byte based ,in other words .a writer is intended for writing text .where as an outputStream is intended for writing raw bytes.

>waht is java FileWriter Class ?
java FileWriter Class is used to write character-oriented data to a file.it ia a character-oriented class which is used for file handling in java
inlike FileOutputStream class you don't need to convert String into a byte array because it provides method to write String directly.

>what is FileReader Class in java io ?
java FileReader class is used to read the data from the file .it returns data in byte format like FileOutputStream class.it is a charactert-Oru=iented class which is used  for fil handling in java.

>what is java BufferedWriter class ?
java BufferedWriter class provides buffering to writer instances.buffering can speed up io quite a bit .Rather than write one character at a time to the network or disk ,the BufferedWriter writes a larger block at a time .this is typically much faster
BufferedWriter br=new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("d:\\ba.txt"))

>what is BufferedReader class in javaio ?
Buffering can speed uo IO quite a bit .rather than read one character at a time from the network or disk .the BufferedReader reads a larger block at a time .this is typically much faster .especially for disk access and larger data amounts

>what is charArrayReader calss ?
java charArray reader class is enables you to read the contents of a char array as a character stream.

>what is CharArrayWriter Class ?
The CharArrayWriter Class is used to write common data to multiple files. this class inherits the writer class .it's buffer automatically growa when data is written in this stream .calling the close() method on this Object has no effect .

>what is StringWriter class in java ?
java StringWriter class enables developer to obtain the character writtern to a writer as a String .the StringWriter is useful if you have a component  that only can write data to a writer but you need that data as a String .

>what is scanner class in java javaio ?
java scanner class is used to get the input from the keyboard ,java.util.Scanner class is onr them, java Scanner class  breaks the input into the tokens using a delimeter that is whitespace by dafault it provides many methods to  read and


>what is Serialization in java ?
serialization in java is a mechanism of writing the state of an Obiect into a byte Stream .serializable interface is the marker interface means it has no data members .it is used to mark java classes so that Objects of these classes may get certain caapability the clonable and remote are also marker interfaces.

>what is Externalizable in java ?
The externalizable interface provides the facility of writing the state of  an Object into a byte stream in compress format. it is not a marker interface.
public void writrExternal and readExternal.

>what is System.out.println() ?
println() is a method of PrintStream class .out is a static Object of printstream class defined in System class System is the class from java.lang package used to interact with the underlyong operating system by the programmer

>what is filter streams >
filter streams are a category of IO streams whose responsibility is to add extrs functionality to the existing streams like giving line numbers in the destination file that do not exist int the source file or increasing performance of copying etc.

>name the filter stream classes on reading side of byte stream ?
there are four classes LineNumberInputStream ,DataInputStream ,BufferedInputStream ,pushbackInputStream

>what is PrintStream and PrintWriter ?
Functionality both are same but belong to two different categories -byte Streams and character streams. println() method exist in both the classes

>what are poped streams ?
there are four piped streams PipedInputStresm, PipedOutputStream, PipedReader and PipedWriter .these streams are very useful to pass data between two running threads

>what is file class ?
it is a non-stream class used to know the properties of a file like when it was created .has read and write permission size etc.

>what is RandomAccessFile ?
it is a special class from java.io package which is neither a input stream nor a output stream beacuse it can do both .it is directly a subclass of Object class, generally, a stream does only one purpose of either reading or writing ,but RandomAccessFile can do both reading from a file and writing  to a file .all the methods of DataInputStream and DataOutputStream  exist in RandomAccesFile.

>what is the purpose of the System class ?
the purpose of the System class is to provide access  to system resources

>what is collection ?
collection is an Object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.

>what is treeset class in java with example ?
treeset implements the sortedSet interface so duplicate values are  not allowed .treeset does not preserved the insertion order of elements but elements are sorted by keys .

>what is the difference between Iterator ans Enumerator ?
the main difference between iterator and enumeration is that .iterator has the method remove() method while Enumeration doesn't have .
Enumeration is the legacy element which only used to traversed the legacy classes of collection like vector ,Hashtable ,stack  where as the Iterator is not used to iterate legacy code .
iterator is fail fast in nature while Enumeration if fail-safe in nature .it does not throw ConcurrentModificationException if collection is modified while iterating.

>what is the difference between queue and stack ?
queue is a data structure which is based on FIFO property where as Stack is a data structure which is based on LIFO property

>what is the difference between poll ,peek and remove methods ?
poll and remove both methods are used to remove the head of the object but the main difference comes is that when an Object is empty poll method returns null while remove method returns NoSuchMethodException.
where  as peek method retrieves the element but does not removes  the head of the Queue .if Queue is empty then peek() method  is returns null.

>what is the difference between ListIrerator and Iterator ?
using Iterator we can traverse the list objects in the forward direction while using ListIterator we can traverse the Collection in both the  direction that is forward as well as backward direction .

>what is hash-collision in Hashtable ?
in Hashtable.if two different keys  have the same hash value then it lead to hash collision .A bucket of type linkedList used to hold the  different keys of same hash value.

>what is IdentityHashMap ?
IdentityHahsMap is a class present in java.util package .it implements the Map interface with a hash table  using reference equality instead of object equality when comparing keys and values. in identityHashMap two keys k1 and k2 are considered equal if only if (k1==k2) it is not synchronized .iterator returned  by the iterator() method  are fail fast hence throw ConcurrentModificationException.

>how can you make collection readOnly ?
we can make  the Collection readOnly by using
Collections.unmodifiableCollection(Collection c)
Collections.unmodifiableMap(Map m)
Collections.unmodifiableList(List l)
Collections.unmidifableSet(Set s)

>what is UnsupportedOperatinException ?
This Exception thrown to indicate that the requested operation is not supported .suppose if you call add() and remove() methods on the readOnly collection .we know readOnly collectoin can not be modified .hence UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown.


>how HashSet internally works ?
HashSet internally uses HashMap for uniqueness. whenever you add HashSet value it creates the object of HashMap
first we creates the map Object with key of  HashSet pass value  type and  value is of dummy object then create the Dummy Object and then initializes the Map in the constructor of HashSet and then in the add method we put the value e and the  dummy object ,

>what is the difference between path and classpath ?
when we install the java on the machine then it is required to set tha path  environment variable to conveniently run the executable file (javac.exe,java.exe,javadoc etc) from any diectory without having to type full path of the command

classPath: classPath is system environment variable used by the java compiler and  jvm .java compiler and jvm is used classpath to determie the location of required class file.

in java to run any program  we use java tool and for compile java code use javac tool all these tools are available in bin filder so we  set path upto bin folder.
where as classpath is set for providing path of all java classes which is used  in our application all classes are available in lib/rt,=.jar file.

// finalize() method in java .
fianlize method is a protected and non static mathod of java.lang.Object class. this method will be available in all Objects that you have created
//whenever java program runs jvm creates three threads
1)  main thread
2) Thread Schedular
3 ) Garbage Collector Thread

we can make finalize()  method to be executed forcefully using either
Runtime.getRuntime().runFinalization() or Runtime.runFinalizersOnExit(true)

//inner join //
inner join is the simplest and most common type of join .it is also known as simpe join.it returns all rows form multiple tables where the join condition is mer.
x: select temp.temp_id,sup.sup_id,order.order_number from sup inner join order on
sup.sup_id=order.order_id;

//equi join //
inner join can have equality and other operators .
equi join only have equality operator in the join condition ,
equi join can be inner join .left join ,right join ,right join

//natural join //
selct * from temp natural join temp2;

//what is the difference between semi join and anti join in sql ?
anti join and semo join both the join is used fetch the data very fastly from the table .anti join query is used to execute query faster .anti join between two tables returns rows from the first table where no matches found in the second table .it is opposite of semi join .anti join returns one copy of each row in the first table for which no mathces is found.
select * from temp where not exists ( select 1 from temp2 where temp.id=temp2.id)
order by temp.id;

>select top 2 salary from table ;
select * from (select * from temp order by salary desc) where rownum<3;


// sql interview questions //

>what is DBMS ?
A Database Management System(DBMS) is a program that controls the creation ,maintenance and use of a database .

>what is the difference between RDBMS and DBMS ?
relational database management system is used application store data in tubular form while DBMS is used applications store data in file form.

>what id normalization ?
normalization is a database design  technique which organizes data in a manner that reduces redundancy and dependency on data. it divides the larger table into a smaller tables and links them using relationships.

>what is integrity constraints ?
integrity provides a way of ensuring that changes made to the database by auhr

>what is index in the database ?
index is used to create and retrieve data from database very quicckly.

>what is view ?
view is  the virtual table that contains the subset of data which present inside the table

>what is a relationship and what are they ?
database relationship is defined as the connection between the tables in a database

>what is trigger ?
trigger is a code or program that executes automatically in the response to some event on the table or view in a database .mainly trigger helps to maintain the integrity of the  database .

>what is constraint ?
constraint can be used to sspecify the limit on the data type of the table .constraints can be specified while creating or altering the table

>how to select alternate rows from the table ?
select * from temp where id in( select decode(mod(rownum,2),0,id,null) from temp);


//  SQL //

>what is sql ?
sql stans structured query langauge which is used to interact with database .sql is an ANSI( american national standards institute)

>what is index ?
a database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and the use of more sorage space to maintain the extra copy data .data can be  stored only in ond order

//when html document is loaded in the browser ,it becomes a document object. it is the root element that represents the html document .it has properties and methods .by the help of document object we can add dynamic content to our web page.
writ();
writeln()
getElementById()
getElementByName()
getElementByTagName()
getElementByClassName()

// sql //
sql is (ANSI) American national Standart  institute.

>what is data integrity ?
data integrity maintains and ensures the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire life .

//SQL ORACLE PRIMARY AND FOREIGN KEY COLUMN NAME OF A TABLE //
TO FIND THE CONSTRAINTS OF A TABLE  WRITE A QUERY
- SELECT * FROM ALL_CONSTRAINTS WHERE TABLE_NAME='XYZ';

//TO FIND THE COLUMN NAME AND TABLE OF A CONSTRAINT

SELECT * FROM ALL_CONS_COLUMNS WHERE CONSTRAINT_NAME='CONS_NAME';//BY THIS QUERY WE CAN GET THE NAME OF THE COLUMN WHICH HAS THE CONSTRAINT NAME .

>what is a schema ?
The set of objects owned by user account is called the schema

>what is trigger ?
trigger is a piece of code that attached with a table and executed after specified DML statement executed on that table .there are 12 types of trigger for a table like. before,after,row,statment,table,insert,updateetc

>what is pseudo columns in a  table ?
pseudo columns are the specific columns in a table that gives the specific values like,sysdate,systimestamp,rowid,rownum.

>WHAT ARE CONSTRAINTS AND THEIR TYPES ?
integrity constraints: it is a declarative way to define a business logic for a column of a table. an integrity constraint is a  statement about a tables data that is always true.

>what is referential integrity and referential integrity constraint ?
referential integrity defines the relationship between different columns of a table in a database. it is called referential integrity because the values in one column or set of columns refer to or match the values in a related columns or set of columns.

the referential  integrity constraint requires that for each row of a  table .the value in the foreign key matches a value in a parent key .

>what is consistency ?
consistency ensures that the data a user viewing or changing is not changed by the other user until is finished with the data.

>what integrity in sql ?
integrity ensures that the database's data and structuress reflected all changes made to them in the correct sequence .

>what is privilage ?
privilage is a right to exacute a particular type of sql statement or to access another users object .types of privilage .
there are two types of privilages ,
system privilage and object privilage .

DML: DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE
DDL: DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE
DRL : DATA RETRIEVATION LANGUAGE
TCL : TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE
DCL : DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE

>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SQL AND PL/SQL ?
SQL OR STRUCTURED QUERY IS A LANGUAGE WHICH IS USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH A RELATIONAL DATABASE. IT PROVIDES A WAY TO MANIPULATE AND CREATE DATABASE.

>what is TCL in sql (TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE ) ?
COMMIT:
ROLLBACK :
SAVEPOINT :
SET SAVEPOINT :


>what is referential integrity ?
Referential Integrity is set of constraints applied to foreign key which prevents entering a row in child table (where you have foreign key) for which you don't have any corresponding row in parent table i.e. entering NULL or invalid foreign keys. Referential Integrity prevents your table from having  incorrect or incomplete relationship e.g. If you have two tables Order and Customer where Customer is parent table with primary key customer_id and Order is child table with foreign key customer_id. Since as per business rules you can not have an Order without a Customer and this business rule can be implemented using referential integrity in SQL on relational database. Referential Integrity will cause failure on any INSERT or UPDATE SQL statement changing value of customer_id in child table, If value of customer_id is not present in Customer table.

>what is constraints in sql ?
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table.
Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.

>what is the difference between webserver and application server ?
webserver is responsible to handle the http request from client browser and respond with html response .a web serrver understands http language and runs on http protocol

>what is the difference GET and POST method ?

>what is MIME type ?
the content-type response header is known as MIME type .server sends MIME type to client to let them know the kind of data it is sending.it helps client in rendering the data for user  some of the mostly used MIME types are text/xml application/xml etc.

//java provides web application support through servlets and jsp that can run in a servlet container and provide  dynamic content to client browser .

>what is servlet ?
java servlet is server side technologies to extend the capability of web server by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence .

>what is the difference between printwriter and servletOutputStream ?
printwriter is a chracter-stream class where as ServletOutputStream is a byte-strwam class we can use printwriter to write charcater based information such as characterOutputStream to write byte array data to the response.

>how we can create deadlock situation in servlet ?
we can create deadlock in servlet by making a loop of method invocation just call doPost() method from doGet() method and doGet() method to doPost() method to create deadlock situation in servlet .

>what is singleThreadModek interface ?
SingleThreadModel interface was provided for thread safety and it guarantees that no two threads will excutes concurrently in the servlet service method .however single thead model does not solve all thread safety

// java web application is used to create the dynamic websites .java provides support for web application through servlets and jsp we can create a website with static html pages but when we want information to be dynamic we need web application

// by default any response written to the outputstream is immediately sent to the client as HTTP response. buffering is the process by which content are written into a buffer before being sent to the client .thus prividng the servlet a better control on the response being sent. buffering also makes effective use of network bandwidth since response is sent to the client after a specified buffer size is reached.

// assuming size if set to 150 kb  only if the buffer is filled  with 150 bytes of data the response will be sent to client .so buffering allows the servlet to control the response till the buffer gets filled up.

// indclude method is used for reusing  common code .like a servlet to print the user login information in all the pages .the common servlet can be include in all the pages .

>what happens if forward method is called after response is commited ?
forward method should be called before response has been committed .if the response had already been committed .forward method throws an illegalStateException .uncommitted output in the response buffer is automatically cleared befote the forward

>what is session managemet ?
session management is a mechanism for maintaining state across multiple HTTP request . this is managed by the web  container  in the other words it is a technique to hold some values passed by user across multiple HTTP request arising out from a single browser instance.

// JSESSIONID. this is similar to how a employee is identified in organization using employee id .Jsession id will be generated the first time the user visis a site .jsessionid will be generated for each browser instance .

> if a servlet is not properly initialized ,what exception may be thrown ?
during initialization or service of a request ,the servlet instances can throw an UnavailableException or a ServletException

>is Servlet thread-safe ?
servlet are not thread safe .if you want to make servlet as thread safe you can  implement singleThreadInterface ,
if we want to make servlet thread safe by implementing  the SingleThreadModel interface

>what is the difference between server and Container ?
A server provides many services to the clients ,A server may contain one or more containers such as ejb containers .servlet/jsp container here a container holds a set of objects.
Container refers to the componet that manges life of cycle servlet and jsp or ejb .server refers to the infrastructure which contains those containers .

>how to detect deadlock in java ?
if nested synchronized block or calling one synchronized method from another synchronized method

>for initializing a servlet can we use a constructor in place of init() method ?

// servlets are instantiated by container by default no-argument constructor and suppose you have declared another constructor which takes a parameter

// java.lang.InstantiationException in servlet

>how can we refresh servlet on client and server  side automatically ?
on the client side we can use Meta HTTP refresh and server side we can use sever push

jsp technology is used to create web application just like servlet technology .it can be though of as an extension to servlet because it provides more functionality than servlet such as expression language .jstl etc.
A JSP page consist of HTML tags and jsp tags the jsp are easier to maintain than servlet because we can  separate designih and development

>what is the life cycle of jsp ?
Translation of jsp page
Compilation of jsp page
Classloading(class file is loaded by the classloader)
instantiation (Object of the generated servelt is created)
initialization ( jspInit() method is invoked by the container )
Destroy (jspDestroy() method is invoked by the container)

>jsp packages?
jsp has two packages
 1)javax.servlet.jsp
 2)javax.servlet.jsp.tagext

 javax.servlet.jsp has classes and interfaces

 classess:
   JspPage
   HttpJspPage

   interfaces :

    JspWriter
    JspFactory
    JspEngineInfo
    JspException
    JspError
    PageContext

>what is jsp ?
JSP stands for javaserver pages .JSP is java server side technology to creat dynamic  pages with HTML like syntax.
TOMCAT/WORK/CATALINA/LOCALHOST/WEBAPP/ORG/APACHE/JSP

>can we use JSP implicit Objects in a method defined in jsp Declaration ?
no we cant because jsp implicit Objects are local to service method and added by jsp Container while translating JSP page to servlet source code.

>what is the use of jsp action tags in jsp ?
jsp specification provides the standard tags for use within your jsp page .these tage are used to remove scriplet tag code from jsp page because scriplet tag are technically not recommended now days.it bad practise to put java code directly inside the your jsp page

>what is the difference between jsp action include and include directive in jsp ?
jsp include directive includes the resouce to generated  servlet at compile time where jsp include action includes the resource at runtime .it is better to use jsp include directive when resource is static like image.header ,footer etc. where if the resource is dynamic then use jsp include action .we can pass the parameter to the include resource in jsp action  using jsp:param while we cant pass the param in jsp include directive.

// jsp is used as a view purpose and servlet is used for business logic purpose .

>what are JSP EL implicit Objects and  how it is different from jsp implicit Objects ?
JSP Expression Language provides many implicit Objects that we can use to get attributes from differenct scopes and values. note that these are different from jsp implicit objects and contains only the attributes in given scope/ the only common implicit Object in jsp el and jsp page is PageContext Object.

>jsp EL implicit Objects.

>whay dont we need to configure JSP standard tags in web.xml ?
we dont need to configure jsp standard tags in web.xml because the TLD file are inside the METS-INF directory of the JSTL jar files .when container loads the web application and finds the TLD file inside the META-INF directory of jar file .it automatically configures them to be used directly in the application jsp pages .all we need to do it to include it in the jsp page using taglib directive.

>how to ignore the EL expression evaluation in a JSP  ?
we can ignore directive as <%@ page isELIgnored="true"%>
<jsp-config>
 <jsp-property-group>
    <url-pattern>*.jsp</url-pattern>
    <el-ignored>true</el-ignored>
  </jsp-property-group>
</jsp-config>

>when will Container initialize multiple jsp/servlet Objects ?
if we have multiple servlet and servlet-mapping elements in deployment descriptor of a single servlet or jsp page/then container will initialize an object for each of the element and all of these instances will have their own ServletConfig Object and init params.

>what is the difference between JspWriter and Servlet PrintWriter ?

>how can i prevent the output of my jsp or servlet pages from being cached by the browser ?
<%
  response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-store");
  response.setHeader("Pragma","no-cache");
  response.setHeader("Expires","0");
%>

// collection of custom tage known as tag library.

>jsp forward action tag .

<jsp:forward page="javatpoint.jsp">
<jsp:param name="parametername" value="parametervalue">
</jsp:forward>

>what is JSP Technology ?
JSP is a standard extension of java and is defined on the top of extensions. it's goal is to simplify management and creation of dynamic web pages .it is pltform independent

>how can the output of jsp or servlet page be prevented from bing cache by the browser ?
using appropriate HTTP header attributes to prevent the dynamic content output by jsp page from being cached by the browser.

>how many types of tags exist in the jstl library ?
core tags
sql tags
xml tags
formatting tags
function tags

// error page handling in the web.xml

<error-page>
<error-code>  </error-code>
<location>    </location>

<error-page>
<exception-type>  </exception-type>
<location>        </location>
</error-page>
>what is the difference between include Directive and include Action tag ?
syntax for include directive is <%@ include file="fileName ".which means that the clling jsp is include to our jsp page when we use include directive contents of included file will be added to calling jsp page at translation time means  when the calling jsp is converted to servlet .all the contents are added to that page one important thing is that any jsp page is compiled if we make any changes to that particular page but if we have changed the included file or jsp page the main calling jsp page will not execute again so the output will not be according to our expectation .this one is the main disadvantage of using the include directive that why it is mostly use to add static resources like Header and footer.

>what is the use of <jsp:useBean> ?
<jsp:useBean> action tag is used to create the instance of the java bean class

>how can one jsp Comunicate with java file ?
we have import tag<%@ page import="market.stock.*%> like this we can import all the java file to our jsp and use them as a regular class another way is servlet can send the instance of the java class to our jsp and we can retrieve that object from the request object and it in our page .

>in jsp page how can we handle runtime exception ?
we can use the errorPage attribute of the page directive to have uncaught run-time exceptions automatically forwarded to an error processing page.
<%@ page errorPage="error.jsp"%>
it will redirect browser to the jsp page error.jsp if an uncaught exception is encountered during the request processing .within error.jsp page, will have  to indicate taht it is an error processing using the directive <%@ page isErrorPage="true" %>

>what is the need of tag library ?
tag library is a collection of custom tags .Custom Action tags hepls recurring tasks will be handled more easily they can be reused across more than one application and increase productivity .jsp tag libraries are used by web application

>what is the difference between pageContext.include and jsp:include ?
the<jsp:include> standard action and the pageContext.include() method are both used to include resoueces at runtime .however the pageContext.include() method always flushes the output of the current page before including the other component.where as <jsp:include> flushes the output of the current apge only if the value of flush is explicitly set to true /
<jsp:include page="/index.jsp" flush

>how jsp works  ?
when a request  comes for jsp page ,that jsp page first translated into servlet class and then that servlet class gets compiled and loaded into heap memory by memory by the web container.all the code written using jsp declaration goes into body of generated servlet as instance variable.and all code from body goes into service() method of generated servlet .in case of tomcat web server these generated servlet files goes inside work directory .jsp file will only be re-compile only if there is a change in jsp file.since resources included using include directive is included using include directive is included during translation time and jsp doesnt recompile if there is any change in include file. so include directive is not suitable to include dynamic resources bescause if included file changes between multiple requested only old value  is used always.include action is better choice for including dynamic resources.

>example to create variable in seesion scope using <c:set> tag in jsp .
<c:set var="currency" value="USD" scope="session"/>
<c:set var="currency" value="${user.currency}" scope="session"/>

>pints to remember on jstl <c:set>
<c:set> can remove attribute if value="null";
the value for JSTL <c:set> tag can be specified in the body also.
jstl set tag value can be runtime expression include jsp expression or EL expression.
>what is the full form of EJB ?
Enterprise JavaBeans(EJB)

>what is the difference between web server and application server ?
web server does not contain EJB Container and  EJB can not be deployed on that. Application server is used to deploy and run EJB in J2EE environment .
the main difference between application server and webserver is that
-application server supports distributed transaction and EJB while web server only    supports Servlet and jsp
-Application Server can contain web server in them .most of app server like JBoss or  WAS has Servlet and JSP container.
-it is not limited to application server but they used to provide services like
 Connection Pooling .transaction management ,messaging ,clustering ,load balancing .
-in terms of logical difference between web server and application server .web server is supposed to provide http protocol level service while application server provides support to web services and expose business level services.
-application server are more heavy than web server in terms of resource utilization .

>what is the difference URL-rewriting and URL-encoding in servlet and jsp ? the main difference between is that URL-rewriting is used to maintain user session if cookies are not enabled on client browser or browser does not supports the cookie  while URL-encoding is a way to pass string to server containing special character by converting special charcaters like spaces into some other characters like + javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse methods encodeURL(String url) and encodeRedirectURL(String URL) is used to encode SessionId on url to support URL-rewriting.
	
   while java.net.URLEncoder.encode() and java.net.URLDecoder.decode() is used to perform URL Encoding and Decoding which replace special character from string to another character.this method used default encoding of system and also

// UNICODE : universal international standard character encoding

// what is object in java  ?
 Object in java is an real world entity that has the state and behaviour is called as Object
 
 object 
 class
 Inheritance
 Polymorphism
 Abstraction
 Encapsulation



Object

Polymorphism

>what is Abstraction in java ?
Hiding internal details and showing only functionality is known as abstraction 

>what is Encapsulation  ?
Biding code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation.

>what is Object ?
Object is an Instance of class and class is a template or blueprint  from which objects are created so object is the instance of  a class .

>what id class ?
class is a group of objects which have common properties .it is a template or blueprint from which objects are created .it is a logical entity  it can't be physical.

>what is method in java ?
method is a function which is used to expose behaviour  of an object .

>what is new keyword ?
The new Keyword is used to  allocate memory at runtime .all objects get memory in heap memory area .

>what is the  meaning of initializing of Object in java ?
initializing the object in java means storing the data into object .

>what is the use of default constructor in java ?
the use of default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object .

>what is the use static keyword in java ?
static keyword in java is used to for memory management we can apply static keyword on variables,method,blocks,nested class while static keyword belongs to a class rather than instance of the class .


>what is type promotion in java ?
when converting one data type into another data type is known as type promotion in java .

Data type    Size

boolean      1byte
byte         1byt
short        2byte
char         2byte
int          4byte
float        4byte
double       8byte
long         8byte

>why we can not override static method in java ?
we can not override static method in java because static method is bound with class where as instance method is bound with object .static belongs to calss area where as instance belongs to heap area.

>what is super keyword in java ?
super keyword in java is reference variable which is used to refer to immediate parent class object.
whenver we create the object the instance of child class instance of parent class is created implicity which is referred by super reference variable.

>what is instance initializer block ?
Instance Initializer block is used to initialize the instance data member .it  runs each time when object of the class is created .

>what is polymorphism in java ?
polymorphism in java is a concept in which we can perform a single task or action in a different ways.there are 2 types of polymorphism in compile time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism .we can perform polymorphism in java by using method overloading and method overriding in java .

>what is Runtime Polymorphism in java ?
Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overriden method is resolved at runtime rather than the compile time .

in this process an overidden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. the determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.

>can java Runtime Poymorphism can achieve with data member ?
method is overriden not the datamembers so ,runtime polymorphism cant be achieved by data members.
Runtime Polymorphism can't be achieved by the data members of class.

>what is static binding and Dynamic Binding in java ?
Connecting the method call to the method body is known as binding .there are two types of binding in java .
static binding and dynamic binding.

static binding: when type of the object is determined at compile time .it is known as static binding.if there is any private,final,or static method in a class thers is a static binding .

>what is binding in java ?
connecting to a method call to a method body is known as binding there are two types of binding in java .dynamic static binding and dynamic binding ,
when type of Object is determined at compile time is known as static 

>what is abstraction ?
abstracton is a process of hiding the implementaton details and showing only functionality to the user.another way it shows only important things to the user and hodes the internal details for example sending sms you just type the text and sends the message .you dont know the internal processing about the message delivery.
